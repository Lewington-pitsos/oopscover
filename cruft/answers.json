They do not have a gap cover arrangement with\nyour insurer.\n\nThe MBS fee for the surgeon\u2019s services is $1,000. Medicare pays $750. Your\nhealth insurer pays $250.  ### Medicare: Australia's public health system\n\nUnlike Australian citizens who can use the public health system\u00c2\n[Medicare](/health_insurance/what_is_covered/medicare.htm \"What is covered by\nMedicare?\")\u00c2 to cover their medical and hospital expenses, overseas visitors\nwho hold temporary visas are not generally eligible to use Medicare.\n\nThis means that if you need medical attention while you are visiting Australia\nyou could find yourself substantially out of pocket. Even in a public hospital\nyou could be charged\u00c2 more than\u00c2 $1,000 a day in hospital fees alone. Without\nhealth cover you can find yourself responsible for the full cost of treatment.\n\nIf you are unsure of your Medicare eligibility status, you should check with\nyour local Medicare office or contact the [Medicare (Services\nAustralia)](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/contact-us \"Link\n- Services Australia - Contact Us\").\n\n The remaining hospital and medical costs will be charged to you - some or all\nof these costs may be covered by your private health insurance, depending on\nyour policy.\n\nThe remaining costs include\u00c2 25% of the MBS fee for doctors' services and any\namount the doctors charge above the MBS fee, plus some or all the costs of:\n\n* hospital accommodation;\n* theatre fees;\n* intensive care;\u00c2\n* drugs, dressings and other consumables;\n* prostheses (surgically implanted);\n* diagnostic tests;\n* pharmaceuticals; and\n* any additional doctor's fees.\n\n|\n\nAs a public patient you will be treated at no charge.\n\n It is equivalent to the amount a public hospital would\ncharge a private patient for a shared room, usually as an all inclusive daily\nrate of approximately $250-$300 depending on where you are in Australia.\n\nIf you are entitled to only the minimum benefit and are attending a private\nhospital, the extra charges you will need to pay yourself include the amount\nabove what the hospital charges for accommodation as well as theatre or labour\nward plus any fees for medical services and other items such as\npharmaceuticals that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t covered by your insurer (see [What is\ncovered?](/health_insurance/what_is_covered/index.htm \"What is covered?\")for\nfurther details).\n\nThe cost of theatre or labour ward in a private facility depends on the\ncomplexity of the procedure being performed and can range from a couple of\nhundred dollars to several thousand dollars.  Pharmacists have the option to discount the patient co-payment by up to a\nmaximum of $1.00, should they choose to do so.\n\n[Private health insurance](/topics/private-health-insurance \"Private health\ninsurance\") covers many services that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover \u2013 like ambulance\nservices, dental services, physiotherapy, glasses and lenses.\n\nThis system helps Australians access the health care they need, while keeping\nthe cost of Medicare sustainable for taxpayers.\n\nRead more about the [cost of Medicare to taxpayers](/node/40784#the-cost-of-\nmedicare-to-taxpayers).\n\n## **Hospital costs**\n\nIf you are a public patient in hospital, Medicare covers all your medical\nexpenses.\n\nIf you are a private patient in a public hospital, Medicare subsidises the\ndoctor fees paid by the patient. You pay for hospital accommodation, theatre\nfees and doctors\u2019 fees. If you have [private health\ninsurance](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/private-health-insurance),\nyou might get some of these costs back, depending on your policy.\n\n You pay $2,450, which is made up\nof:\n\n* $800 for your surgeon and $600 for other providers\n* your hospital charge excess of $750\n\n## Gap arrangements for hospital treatment\n\nDoctors set their own fees for private medical services. They can charge more\nthan the MBS fee set by the Australian Government.\n\nWhen a doctor\u2019s fee for hospital treatment is higher than the MBS fee, the\ndifference is called the gap. You pay the gap, or your private health insurer\nmight where there is a gap cover arrangement. It\u2019s normal for there to be out\nof pocket costs in many situations. However, many doctors and insurers use gap\narrangements to remove or reduce your gap payment.\n\n ## What out of pocket costs you might pay\n\nAny out of pocket costs you pay will vary depending on:\n\n* how much you are charged\n* whether you have treatment in hospital or outside hospital\n* whether your treatment is covered by Medicare and [how much Medicare pays](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/subjects/whats-covered-medicare)\n* if you are treated at a hospital, whether you are a public or private patient\n* whether you have private cover for the treatment and if so, your level of cover\n\nDoctor\u2019s fees can only be covered by private health insurance for treatment in\nhospital.
