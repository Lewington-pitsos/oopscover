You may also consider shopping around to see what\nother specialists charge or consider being treated as a public patient at a\npublic hospital.\n\nYou should contact your health insurer to ask about benefits for your\nhospitalisation and your medical bills.\n\n ### Hospital charges for private patients\n\nHospital charges you might have to pay as a private patient include:\n\n* accommodation\n* operating theatre fees\n* [prostheses](/topics/private-health-insurance/what-private-health-insurance-covers/prostheses-cover-under-private-health-insurance \"Prostheses cover under private health insurance\") costs, for example plates, screws, artificial joints\n* medicines and dressings\n* costs for physiotherapy and other therapies in hospital\n\nIf you have private hospital insurance the amount your insurer will pay for\nthese depends on:\n\n* your policy\n* whether your insurer has an agreement with the hospital\n\nSome policies pay only the Government mandated minimum amount for hospital\ncharges for all or some types of treatment. This could mean you pay high out\nof pocket costs.\n\n The MBS fee for the surgeon\u2019s services is $1,000. Medicare pays $750. Your\nhealth insurer pays $250. This leaves an $800 gap you have to pay.\n\nYou also needed an anaesthetist, assistant surgeon, radiology and pathology\ntests. You can work out your out of pocket costs for them the same way you\nworked out the surgeon\u2019s. For this example, assume their total fees were\n$3,500 and you must pay $600 out of pocket.\n\nYour hospital charges are $8,500. Your insurer pays most of this cost but\nthere is no Medicare benefit. You must pay an excess of $750.\n\nThe total costs of your treatment is $13,800. You pay $2,450, which is made up\nof:\n\n* $800 for your surgeon and $600 for other providers\n* your hospital charge excess of $750\n\n## Gap arrangements for hospital treatment\n\nDoctors set their own fees for private medical services.  Your benefit must be no less than 85% of the average charge for similar\ntreatment in another hospital of the same category.\n\nWe publish a list of all [Commonwealth-declared hospitals (Excel, 292\nKB)](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/765860CBE64ED1E4CA257BF0001915B4/$File/All%20Declared%20Hospitals%20\\(current%20as%20at%2010%20July%202020\\).xlsx).\n\nYou can use this list to check:\n\n* whether a hospital is second-tier default benefits eligible\n* its second-tier default benefits eligibility category\n\n### Work out your hospital admission costs\n\nAs a private patient your total out of pocket costs will be the sum of all\nhospital charges, doctors\u2019 fees and fees from other providers, minus any\nMedicare or private health insurance payments.\n\n**Example:**\n\nYou have private hospital insurance for an operation in a private hospital.\nYour policy has a $750 excess and no co-payment.\n\nYour surgeon charges $1,800. They do not have a gap cover arrangement with\nyour insurer.\n\nThe MBS fee for the surgeon\u2019s services is $1,000. Medicare pays $750. Your\nhealth insurer pays $250.  ### Medicare: Australia's public health system\n\nUnlike Australian citizens who can use the public health system\u00c2\n[Medicare](/health_insurance/what_is_covered/medicare.htm \"What is covered by\nMedicare?\")\u00c2 to cover their medical and hospital expenses, overseas visitors\nwho hold temporary visas are not generally eligible to use Medicare.\n\nThis means that if you need medical attention while you are visiting Australia\nyou could find yourself substantially out of pocket. Even in a public hospital\nyou could be charged\u00c2 more than\u00c2 $1,000 a day in hospital fees alone. Without\nhealth cover you can find yourself responsible for the full cost of treatment.\n\nIf you are unsure of your Medicare eligibility status, you should check with\nyour local Medicare office or contact the [Medicare (Services\nAustralia)](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/contact-us \"Link\n- Services Australia - Contact Us\").\n\n The remaining hospital and medical costs will be charged to you - some or all\nof these costs may be covered by your private health insurance, depending on\nyour policy.\n\nThe remaining costs include\u00c2 25% of the MBS fee for doctors' services and any\namount the doctors charge above the MBS fee, plus some or all the costs of:\n\n* hospital accommodation;\n* theatre fees;\n* intensive care;\u00c2\n* drugs, dressings and other consumables;\n* prostheses (surgically implanted);\n* diagnostic tests;\n* pharmaceuticals; and\n* any additional doctor's fees.\n\n|\n\nAs a public patient you will be treated at no charge.\n\n It is equivalent to the amount a public hospital would\ncharge a private patient for a shared room, usually as an all inclusive daily\nrate of approximately $250-$300 depending on where you are in Australia.\n\nIf you are entitled to only the minimum benefit and are attending a private\nhospital, the extra charges you will need to pay yourself include the amount\nabove what the hospital charges for accommodation as well as theatre or labour\nward plus any fees for medical services and other items such as\npharmaceuticals that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t covered by your insurer (see [What is\ncovered?](/health_insurance/what_is_covered/index.htm \"What is covered?\")for\nfurther details).\n\nThe cost of theatre or labour ward in a private facility depends on the\ncomplexity of the procedure being performed and can range from a couple of\nhundred dollars to several thousand dollars.  Pharmacists have the option to discount the patient co-payment by up to a\nmaximum of $1.00, should they choose to do so.\n\n[Private health insurance](/topics/private-health-insurance \"Private health\ninsurance\") covers many services that Medicare doesn\u2019t cover \u2013 like ambulance\nservices, dental services, physiotherapy, glasses and lenses.\n\nThis system helps Australians access the health care they need, while keeping\nthe cost of Medicare sustainable for taxpayers.\n\nRead more about the [cost of Medicare to taxpayers](/node/40784#the-cost-of-\nmedicare-to-taxpayers).\n\n## **Hospital costs**\n\nIf you are a public patient in hospital, Medicare covers all your medical\nexpenses.\n\nIf you are a private patient in a public hospital, Medicare subsidises the\ndoctor fees paid by the patient. You pay for hospital accommodation, theatre\nfees and doctors\u2019 fees. If you have [private health\ninsurance](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/private-health-insurance),\nyou might get some of these costs back, depending on your policy.\n\n You pay $2,450, which is made up\nof:\n\n* $800 for your surgeon and $600 for other providers\n* your hospital charge excess of $750\n\n## Gap arrangements for hospital treatment\n\nDoctors set their own fees for private medical services. They can charge more\nthan the MBS fee set by the Australian Government.\n\nWhen a doctor\u2019s fee for hospital treatment is higher than the MBS fee, the\ndifference is called the gap. You pay the gap, or your private health insurer\nmight where there is a gap cover arrangement. It\u2019s normal for there to be out\nof pocket costs in many situations. However, many doctors and insurers use gap\narrangements to remove or reduce your gap payment.\n\n ## What out of pocket costs you might pay\n\nAny out of pocket costs you pay will vary depending on:\n\n* how much you are charged\n* whether you have treatment in hospital or outside hospital\n* whether your treatment is covered by Medicare and [how much Medicare pays](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/subjects/whats-covered-medicare)\n* if you are treated at a hospital, whether you are a public or private patient\n* whether you have private cover for the treatment and if so, your level of cover\n\nDoctor\u2019s fees can only be covered by private health insurance for treatment in\nhospital. Different insurers might pay a different amount for the same\nservice. Talk to your doctor, hospital and health insurer about:\n\n* what your costs might be\n* when you must pay them\n\nSee our [practical tips for exploring the costs of medical treatment\noptions](/resources/publications/a-guide-to-out-of-pocket-medical-costs-\nhelping-you-plan-for-the-cost-of-medical-treatment \"A guide to out of pocket\nmedical costs \u2013 helping you plan for the cost of medical treatment\").\n\n\n===\n Q: If I break my leg and go to hospital, how much will it cost me?

The cheapest policy may not be the\nbest or right for you.\n\n### Lowering your premiums\n\nIf the cost of your insurance has become\u00c2 a concern, you can manage your\npolicy to allow you to have lower premiums.\n\n But they can ask you to pay an upfront amount before they provide you\ntreatment.\n\nBill splitting is when a doctor issues 2 different bills for the same\ntreatment. Your doctor might:\n\n* send one bill to Medicare and your private health insurer for the benefits they will pay\n* send another bill to you for out of pocket costs\n\nDoctors sometimes split bills to work around gap cover agreements where they\nhave agreed with an insurer not to charge you more than a certain amount.\nSplit bills also mean the Government and insurers don\u2019t find out full details\nof the fees being charged for services they subsidise.\n\nAsk your specialist for a written estimate of your costs in advance. You\nshould expect a final invoice that reflects all the costs.\n\n What excess (if any) you will need to pay depends on the policy you take out.\nAlways check with your insurer.\n\nExclusions\n\nConditions or services which your health insurance policy does not include, meaning that your insurer will not pay benefits towards hospital or medical costs for these items.

The proposed overseas treatment or an effective alternative treatment are not available in Australia, and won\u2019t be available in time to benefit you.\n2. The overseas treatment will either significantly extend your life or potentially cure your condition.\n3. The overseas treatment has a real prospect of being successful.\n4. The Australian medical profession accepts the overseas treatment as a standard form of treatment for your condition.\n\n This Review has found that for many the cost of\nhealth insurance is problematic and coverage may be less than is provided\nunder Medicare. However, private health insurance premiums for those who are\nMedicare eligible are also high and many Australians also have exposure to\nincreasing out of pocket expenses for health services.\n\nThis Review has demonstrated that since inception of the 410 visa, eligibility\nfor Medicare for this group has evolved over time. Those policy and\nlegislative settings reflect a range of immigration, health and social policy\nconsiderations that include, but are broader than, the concerns of 410 visa\nholders.\n\nIt is clear that at least since 1998, 410 visa holders have been consistently\nadvised that they will not be eligible for Medicare under an RHCA as they are\n\u2018ordinarily resident\u2019 in Australia.  Eligibility for Medicare is governed by the HIA, and\neligible persons can choose to have Medicare cover only, or a combination of\nMedicare and private health insurance. An \u2018eligible person\u2019 is defined in\nsubsection 3(1) of the HIA, as either an Australian resident or an \u2018eligible\noverseas representative\u2019.\n\nThe category of \u2018Australian resident\u2019 includes persons who reside in Australia\nand are either New Zealand citizens, holders of permanent residence visas and\napplicants for permanent residence in certain circumstances. Eligible overseas\nrepresentatives include members of a diplomatic mission and their families,\nfrom countries with which Australia has a RHCA.\n\n In relation to:\n\n* the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Norway, it means \u2018lawfully present but not ordinarily resident\u2019;\n* New Zealand, the Netherlands, Belgium and Slovenia, it means \u2018lawfully present but not resident\u2019;\n* Malta, it means \u2018present for a period not exceeding 6 months\u2019; and\n* Italy, it is not specified, although that agreement does specify that it applies only for six months from the visitor\u2019s time of arrival.\n\nTo be eligible to receive Medicare in Australia under the RHCA with the UK, a\nperson must be:\n\n* ordinarily resident in the UK; and\n* lawfully present but not ordinarily resident in Australia.\n\n If you are unsure of your Medicare eligibility status, you should check with\nyour local Medicare office or contact the [Medicare (Services\nAustralia)](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/contact-us \"Link\n- Services Australia - Contact Us\").\n\nIf your visa status or Medicare eligibility changes at any time, inform your\ninsurer as soon as possible to find out whether your level of cover is still\nsuitable.\n\n#### Reciprocal Medicare\n\nIf you are an overseas visitors from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Belgium,\u00c2\nFinland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia, the Republic of Ireland,\nNorway and New Zealand, you generally have access to Medicare under your\ncountry's\u00c2 [reciprocal health care\nagreement](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/reciprocal-\nhealth-care-agreements/when-you-visit-australia \"Link - Medicare Healthcare\nfor visitors to Australia\")\u00c2 with Australia. This means you can receive\nemergency treatment in the public health system free of charge, which you\nwould not otherwise be entitled to.\n\n Under the legislative framework in place since 1 February 1989, persons coming\nto Australia are not eligible for Medicare unless they:\n\n* meet the definition of \u2018Australian resident\u2019 under subsection 3(1) of the HIA; or\n* are from a RHCA country and meet the eligibility criteria for the relevant RHCA; or\n* are the subject of a subsection 6(1) order.\n\nGenerally, in order to meet the conditions of Medicare eligibility under the\nRHCAs a person must be \u2018ordinarily resident\u2019 in their home country and either\n\u2018not ordinarily resident in Australia\u2019 or \u2018lawfully present but not resident\nin Australia\u2019.\n\nA person may also be determined to be an \u2018eligible person\u2019 by an order under\nsubsection 6(1) of the HIA.  Medicare and the public hospital system provide free or low-cost access for\nall Australians to most of these health care services. Private health\ninsurance gives you choice outside the public system. For private health care\nboth in and out of hospital, you contribute towards the cost of your health\ncare.\n\n## Medicare \u2013 the foundation of our health system\n\nMedicare has been Australia\u2019s universal health care scheme since 1984. Its 3\nmajor parts are:\n\n* medical services\n* public hospitals\n* medicines\n\nMedicare is available to Australian and New Zealand citizens, permanent\nresidents in Australia, and people from [countries with reciprocal\nagreements](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/reciprocal-\nhealth-care-agreements).\n\nMedicare covers all of the cost of public hospital services. It also covers\nsome or all of the costs of other health services. These can include services\nprovided by GPs and medical specialists. They can also include physiotherapy,\ncommunity nurses and basic dental services for children.\n\n For all\nintents and purposes, whilst many of these visa holders have become part of\nthe Australian community, they are not able to receive some of the benefits of\nbeing a permanent resident of Australia, by virtue of the conditions applied\nto their visa.\n\nThis group of visa holders is an ageing cohort and as they age, inevitably\ntheir use of health services increases. Understandably access to affordable\nhealth care becomes a prominent concern. Health problems also mean that some\nmay not be well enough to return to their home country and re-establish their\nlives and social networks. This Review has found that for many the cost of\nhealth insurance is problematic and coverage may be less than is provided\nunder Medicare.  Medicare will also cover some or all the costs of seeing a GP or\nspecialist outside of hospital, and some pharmaceuticals.\n\nMedicare does not cover private patient hospital costs, ambulance services,\nand other out of hospital services such as dental, physiotherapy, glasses and\ncontact lenses, hearings aids.
