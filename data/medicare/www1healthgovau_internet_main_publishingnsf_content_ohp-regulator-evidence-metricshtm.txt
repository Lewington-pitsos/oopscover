# Health Regulator Evidence Metrics

This page contains the evidence metrics of participating Health regulators
under the Regulator Performance Framework (RPF). Each participating Health
regulator has developed output or activity-based evidence metrics against the
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) under the RPF. These are used to assess
their regulatory performance in the annual self-assessments and periodic
external review processes.
