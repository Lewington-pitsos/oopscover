The MRAC provides independent and expert advice to the Australian Government
as part of the [MBS Continuous Review](https://www.health.gov.au/our-
work/medicare-benefits-schedule-mbs-continuous-review). These reviews ensure
the MBS continues to support high-quality care that remains flexible and
contemporary.

When completing reviews of relevant issues or existing MBS items, the MRAC
will produce and endorse a Final Report. Final Reports can make a range of
recommendations to government, including:

  * changing existing MBS items
  * creating new items
  * removing current items
  * no substantive changes
  * a combination of these.

After completing a review, the MRAC will endorse a Final Report and provide it
the Minister for Health and Aged Care.

When considering advice or recommendations in a Final Report, the government
will also consider:

  * broader healthcare reform initiatives
  * competing government priorities
  * the federal budget.

When the government seeks to make changes to MBS items, it will announce its
decision and outline the proposed changes. The timeline for making changes
includes:

  * budget processes
  * engaging with impacted sectors
  * other influential considerations.
