## Overview

We are seeking feedback to inform a National Dementia Action Plan.

The National Dementia Action Plan is a joint initiative between the Australian
Government and state and territory governments. It is a 10 year plan to put
people living with dementia, their families, and carers at the centre of all
action on dementia.

The National Dementia Action Plan will provide a vision where Australians
understand dementia – people living with dementia and their carers have the
best quality of life possible and no one walks the dementia journey alone.

It will mean better coordinated approaches to dementia risk reduction, early
diagnosis and improvements in services for people living with dementia and
their carers.

## Why your views matter

We want to ensure that the voices of people with lived experience of dementia
and those involved in their care are reflected in Australia’s priorities for
action on dementia, including:

  * people living with dementia 
  * their carers, families and friends 
  * people who work in primary care, health, acute or aged care 
  * researchers and academics. 

## What happens next

Your feedback will shape the final National Dementia Action Plan, which will
be finalised in 2023.
