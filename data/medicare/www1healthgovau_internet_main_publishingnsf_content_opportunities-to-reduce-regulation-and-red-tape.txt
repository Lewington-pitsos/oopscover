# Opportunities to Reduce Regulation and Red Tape

 __Page last updated: 17 February 2016

The government is committed to reducing regulatory burden and red tape through
the delivery of effective regulation and programmes. In delivering the
regulatory reform agenda, Health will consult with a range of stakeholders to
ensure that a broad variety of views are considered.  
  

## Policy Background Paper – Open for Comment

A Policy Background Paper: _Reducing Regulation in the Health Portfolio_ , has
been developed to assist with the identification of ideas for reducing
regulatory and red tape burden in the health sector.
