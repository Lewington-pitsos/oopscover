### Support and other contact information available to you

In the unlikely event that incorrect information is uploaded to your record,
or that information is missing - there are steps you can take to check that
the information stored in your record is correct.

## Incorrect information

If you find incorrect information in your record, **please contact us as soon
as possible on[1800 723 471](tel:1800 723 471) (option 1).** You can also
[remove the document from your record](/initiatives-and-programs/my-health-
record/manage-your-record/privacy-and-access/hide-or-remove-documents-from-a-
record "Hide or remove documents from a record").

If the incorrect information is in a document from a healthcare provider (e.g.
your GP), you should ask them to correct this.

## Missing information

The first time you access your record, there may be little or no information
in it.

If information is missing from your record, first check that your healthcare
provider is connected and able to upload documents to the My Health Record
system. If they are, ask them to upload the document to your record.

Note that if your healthcare provider is not yet connected to the My Health
Record system, they won’t be able to access your record or upload documents.

### Missing or incomplete immunisation details

If the information in your **Immunisations** page is empty or seems
incomplete:

  * Check your **Medicare Information Settings** under the **Profile & Settings** tab.
  * Make sure **Yes** is selected for **All information about immunisations recorded on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR).** Selecting **Yes** will also allow your healthcare providers to see your immunisation information.

### Incomplete immunisation history statement

It can take a few days for new vaccinations to show on your immunisation
history statement. If you've recently had a COVID-19 vaccination and it's not
showing on your statement, please check again in a few days.

If it's still not showing after a few days and your vaccination provider has
sent the details to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), call the
Australian Immunisation Register general enquiries line on [1800 653
809](tel:1800 653 809) (Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm).

## Matching Medicare information

Your personal details recorded in Medicare and those you give to your
healthcare provider need to match so information can be uploaded to My Health
Record.

If your healthcare provider is unable to match your personal details with
those recorded in Medicare, your provider will not be able to access your
record or upload documents.

If your details have changed and you need to update them, contact Medicare
[132 011](tel:132 011) or visit the [Medicare website for more
information.](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-you-update-your-name-
date-birth-or-gender-for-medicare?context=60092 "External link opens new
