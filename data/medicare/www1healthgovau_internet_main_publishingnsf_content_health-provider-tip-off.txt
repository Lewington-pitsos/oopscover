  * Reports about patient safety or harm - submit these to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency ([AHPRA](https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Notifications.aspx))
  * Rude, racist, inappropriate professional conduct, not listening, dismissive, service quality or interaction issues (also [AHPRA](https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Notifications.aspx))
  * Suspected Medicare, pharmaceutical or Centrelink fraud by a member of the public (not a health provider or their employee) – submit these to [Services Australia](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/reporting-fraud?context=26266)
  * Suspected fraud against activities funded by the Department of Health and Aged Care (such as services, grants or other payments); or fraud or corruption by departmental staff – refer to [Report suspected fraud - Department of Health and Aged Care](https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/corporate-reporting/report-suspected-fraud).
