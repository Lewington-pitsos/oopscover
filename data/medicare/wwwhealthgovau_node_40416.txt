## **Accessing Medicare for health practitioners**

Before being able to bill for Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items under
Medicare, health practitioners must:

  * complete approved education
  * be registered with the [national board](https://www.ahpra.gov.au/National-Boards.aspx) relevant to their profession
  * meet [eligibility requirements](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/eligibility-to-access-medicare-benefits-medicare-benefits-for-health-professionals?context=34076) set out in the [Health Insurance Act 1973](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2022C00174) or the relevant legislation relating to their health profession

  * be [recognised by Services Australia](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/recognition-for-medicare-benefits-medicare-benefits-for-health-professionals?context=34076)
  * have a [Medicare provider number](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/services/medicare/medicare-benefits-health-professionals/apply-provider-number-or-prescriber-number/if-youre-health-professional) to provide services
  * [claim benefits as required](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/claim-benefit-medicare-benefits-for-health-professionals?context=34076).

All health practitioners must meet [Medicare compliance
requirements](/topics/medicare/compliance "Medicare compliance") to:

  * [prescribe](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-to-apply-for-provider-number-if-youre-health-professional?context=34076) or [claim for supply](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/claiming-online-for-pbs-medicines?context=22861) of subsidised medicines
  * bill or claim for subsidised services
  * receive payments under Medicare.

We identify and investigate potential fraud, inappropriate practice and
incorrect billing under Medicare through different types of compliance
activities.

## **Accreditation and standards to access Medicare benefits**

### **Pathology services**

Pathology services must meet [accreditation
standards](https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/node/6488) to ensure quality of
care and the safety of patients.

Pathology services can only access Medicare MBS item benefits if:

  * the laboratory is [accredited](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/accredited-pathology-laboratories)
  * an [approved pathology practitioner](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/approved-pathology-practitioners) provides the service
  * the proprietor is an [Approved Pathology Authority](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/approved-pathology-authorities).

Learn more about [pathology accreditation](/node/43414#pathology-
accreditation).

### **Diagnostic imaging services**

Diagnostic imaging services must meet [accreditation
standards](https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/standards/diagnostic-
imaging/diagnostic-imaging-accreditation-scheme-standards) to ensure quality
of care and the safety of patients.

Diagnostic imaging services can only access Medicare MBS item benefits if
they:

  * have a [location specific practice number](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-to-register-your-practice?context=23066)
  * are [accredited](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-to-get-your-practice-accredited-once-you-have-location-specific-practice-number-lspn?context=23066) under the [Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation Scheme](https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/standards/diagnostic-imaging/diagnostic-imaging-accreditation-scheme)
  * have [eligible equipment](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/diagnostic-imaging/mri-and-pet-locations).

Learn more about [diagnostic imaging
accreditation](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/medicare-eligibility-to-
provide-diagnostic-imaging-and-radiation-oncology-services).

## **Accessing Medicare subsidies for industry**

Manufacturers and sponsors of a health service or product can
[apply](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/health-technologies-and-
digital-health/health-technology-assessments/for-subsidy#how-to-apply) for it
to be listed on the
[MBS](http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/Home)
or [Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)
Schedule](https://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home). We then conduct a [health
technology assessment](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/health-
technologies-and-digital-health/health-technology-assessments/for-subsidy) to
decide whether to subsidise it.

We’re building the [Health Products
Portal](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/health-products-
portal-initiative) so we can work more efficiently with the medicines and
technology sector. The portal will enable industry to make, track, pay for
(where applicable), and manage submissions for new products and services to be
listed on the MBS and PBS Schedule.
