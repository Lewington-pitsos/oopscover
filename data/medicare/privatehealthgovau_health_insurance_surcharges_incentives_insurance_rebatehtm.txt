###  How can I work out my rebate entitlement?

You can use the table above or the [Private Health Insurance Rebate
Calculator](http://www.ato.gov.au/Calculators-and-tools/Private-health-
insurance-rebate-calculator/ "Link - ATO - Private Health Insurance Rebate
Calculator") on the ATO website, or call the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
on **132 861**. **  
**

### Claiming the Rebate

If you are eligible for the rebate, there are two ways you can claim:

  * as a premium reduction through your private health insurer (you pay less upfront to your insurer). If you want to claim your rebate as a reduced premium, contact your insurer; or
  * as a tax offset when lodging your annual tax return. For more information about claiming your rebate as a tax offset, visit the [Australian Taxation Office](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-and-private-health-insurance/Private-health-insurance-rebate/ "Link - ATO - Rebate") or callÂ 132 861. 

If you choose to receive your rebate through your insurer, you will be asked
to nominate the income tier you expect to fall into. You can nominate your
tier by contacting your insurer or by filling out the Medicare rebate claim
form.

For further information about claiming the rebate please visit the ATO's
website:Â [](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-and-private-health-
insurance/Private-health-insurance-rebate/ "Link - ATO Private Health
Insurance Rebate and MLS")[Private Health Insurance
Rebate](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-and-private-health-
insurance/Private-health-insurance-rebate/ "Link - ATO - Rebate").  

### What happens if I nominate an incorrect tier?

If you choose to claim the rebate as a premium reduction, you will be asked to
nominate a tier based on your estimated income.  
  
If you nominate a higher tier than your actual income, you will receive a
lower rebate than your income entitlements. If that happens, you will receive
a tax offset through your income tax return for that financial year.  
  
If you nominate a lower tier than your actual income, you will receive a
higher rebate than your income entitlements. If that happens, you will incur a
tax liability through your income tax return for that financial year. This
means you could have a tax debt. There are no additional penalties for
estimating your income incorrectly.  
  
Usually your rebate information will be auto-filled as part of your income tax
return.Â You can also request a statement from your private health insurer at
the end of the financial year to help you complete your tax return.

### Rebate Calculations

From 1 April 2014, the rebate contribution from the Australian Government has
been calculated based on a Rebate Adjustment Factor.  

The Rebate Adjustment Factor is determined using a formula which takes into
account growth in the Consumer Price Index and the industry weighted average
premium increase.Â Â

### The rebate and Lifetime Health Cover  

[Lifetime Health
Cover](/health_insurance/surcharges_incentives/lifetime_health_cover.htm
"Lifetime Health Cover") (LHC) is a financial loading applied on top of your
hospital premium at a rate of 2% for every year you are aged over 30 when you
take out hospital cover, up to a maximum of 70%. The LHC loading is removed
once you have held hospital cover and paid the loading for 10 continuous
years.

If you currently pay a LHC loading, the Rebate does not apply to the LHC
component of your hospital cover premiums (as of 1 July 2013). You still
receive the Rebate on the standard component of your hospital cover. For
information about your policy and for quotes on premiums, please contact your
health insurer.
