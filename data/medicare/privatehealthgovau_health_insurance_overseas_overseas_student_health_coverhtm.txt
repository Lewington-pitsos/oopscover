## Overseas Student Health Cover

If you are a student from overseas on a temporary student visa, it is a
condition of your visa to maintain Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)Â for
the duration of your visa. This type of cover assists international students
to meet the costs of medical and hospital care they may need while in
Australia. OSHC also includes ambulance cover and limited pharmaceuticals.

If you are a student from overseas on a temporary student visa it is a
condition of your visa to maintain adequate health insurance for the duration
of your stay in Australia. This means you need to purchase Overseas Student
Health Cover (OSHC) and keep your policy up to date whilst you are in
Australia and holding a student visa.  

OSHC assists international students to meet the costs of medical and hospital
care they may need while in Australia. OSHC also includes ambulance cover and
limited pharmaceuticals.  

Some exceptions may apply if you are a student from Sweden, Norway, or
Belgium. If this applies to you, you may have special arrangements under your
own national schemes - check with theÂ [](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/ "Link
- Department of Home Affairs")[](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/ "Link -
Department of Home Affairs")[Department of Home
Affairs](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/ "Link - Department of Home Affairs")Â
to find out if special arrangements apply to you and if you are exempt from
the requirement to purchase OSHC.

As holding OSHC is a visa requirement, take care to maintain your cover at all
times. If you do fall behind in payments or renewing your cover, you will be
able to continue your cover but you may not be able to claim for services you
received while you were in arrears.

If your visa status or Medicare eligibility changes at any time, inform your
insurer as soon as possible to find out whether your level of cover is still
suitable.Â When your student visa expires, then youÂ are no longer eligible to
hold OSHC.Â Â You can thenÂ swap over to a residents' cover or to anÂ
[Overseas Visitors Health
Cover](/health_insurance/overseas/overseas_visitors_health_cover.htm "Overseas
Visitors Health Cover")Â plan.

#### Medicare and OSHC

If you are in Australia on a student visa from the United Kingdom, Sweden, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Slovenia, Italy or New Zealand, you can also apply for
Medicare under your country's [Reciprocal Health Care
Agreements](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/reciprocal-
health-care-agreements/when-you-visit-australia "Link - Medicare Healthcare
for visitors to Australia"). (Students from Norway, Finland, Malta and the
Republic of Ireland are not covered by the agreements with those countries.)

Any Medicare coverage you are entitled to under a Reciprocal Health Care
Agreement will be in addition to OSHC. Having reciprocal access to Medicare
does not exempt you from needing to take out OSHC.

#### What does OSHC cover?

OSHC policies assist to cover the cost of hospital and medical treatment.
Benefits are also paidÂ for ambulance services.Â

The minimum requirements of a OSHC policy are set out in the
[](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/overseas-student-health-
cover-oshc-resources "Link - Department of Health - OSHC Deed")[OSHC
Deed](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/overseas-student-health-
cover-oshc-resources "Link - Department of Health - OSHC Deed"). The
Department of Health and Aged Care also provides [Explanatory Guidelines for
the Deed](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/overseas-student-
health-cover-oshc-resources "Link - Department of Health - OSHC Deed") and a
[One-Page Fact
Sheet](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/overseas-student-
health-cover-oshc-resources "Link - Department of Health - OSHC Deed") about
what is included under the Deed and how OSHC works. For further information,
check with your OSHC insurer.

OSHC does not pay for general treatment (ancillary, or extras cover) such as
dental, optical or physiotherapy. If you require cover for these treatments,
you may take Extras OSHC provided by an OSHC provider or general treatment
cover with any Australian private health insurer. You can also choose to
supplement OSHC with other insurance such as international travel insurance.

#####  OSHC and pharmaceuticals

Only limited benefits for pharmaceuticals apply,Â limited toÂ $50 per
pharmaceutical item to a maximum of $300 a year for single membership ($600
for a family membership). You may face significant out of pocket costs if you
need treatment with pharmaceuticals, particularly oncology (cancer) treatment
which can costs tens of thousands of dollars.

Travellers entering Australia may bring in medicines and medical devices for
immediate use and to import small quantities for personal use. For more
information see the Therapeutic Goods Administration website -Â

Administration - Entering Australia")[Entering
Australia](https://www.tga.gov.au/entering-australia "Link - Therapeutic Goods

### Where can I purchase OSHC?

OSHC is offered by certain insurers under a [Deed of
Agreement](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/overseas-student-
health-cover-oshc-resources "Link - Department of Health - OSHC Deed") with
the Department of Health and Aged Care to provide adequate health insurance to
students at a reasonable cost.Â Only a small number of registered health
insurers offer OSHC:
