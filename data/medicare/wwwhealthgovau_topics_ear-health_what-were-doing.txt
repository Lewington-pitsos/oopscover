## Programs

We fund programs to support Australians with hearing loss:

  * [Various initiatives](/our-work/roadmap-for-hearing-health-initiatives "Roadmap for Hearing Health initiatives") based on the recommendations from the [Roadmap for Hearing Health](/resources/publications/roadmap-for-hearing-health "Roadmap for Hearing Health ") will help improve the hearing health of Australians.
  * The [Hearing Services Program](/our-work/hearing-services-program "Hearing Services Program") provides hearing services, including devices, to [eligible people](/resources/apps-and-tools/hearing-services-program-check-your-eligibility-voucher-status-and-last-known-service-provider "Hearing Services Program – Check your eligibility, voucher status and last known service provider") to help manage their hearing loss and improve engagement with the community.
  * The [National Framework for Neonatal Hearing Screening](/resources/publications/national-framework-for-neonatal-hearing-screening "National Framework for Neonatal Hearing Screening") outlines Australia's national approach to screening all babies for hearing impairment to ensure they can access support early.
  * Several policies and programs aim to [prevent, treat and monitor ear disease in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people](/topics/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-health/primary-care/ear-health-and-hearing-support "Ear and hearing health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people").

health](/topics/ear-health/programs "Ear health programs and initiatives").

## **Resources**

We fund and provide resources to help Australians understand and prevent ear
disease and hearing loss:

  * [Care for Kids’ Ears](/our-work/care-for-kids-ears "Care for Kids' Ears") helps people who care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children recognise and prevent ear disease.
  * The [Know Your Noise](https://knowyournoise.nal.gov.au/) website provides a free online hearing test and advice on whether your lifestyle might be damaging your ears.
  * The [Sound Scouts app](https://www.soundscouts.com/au/) makes hearing checks for children easy. The test is like a fun game, so the children don’t know it’s a test. It provides an instant report and what to do next if there is a problem.
  * The [otitis media (middle ear infection) clinical care guidelines](https://otitismediaguidelines.com/#/start-main) help health professionals manage ear conditions. Our [Research Strategy – Hearing Health](/resources/publications/research-strategy-hearing-health "Research Strategy – Hearing Health") sets out how our funding to NAL is managed.

## **Medicare and insurance benefits**

We help reduce the cost of hearing services and products through:

  * the [Prostheses List](/resources/publications/prostheses-list "Prostheses List"), which outlines the products – such as cochlear implants – that private health insurers pay benefits for
  * the [Medicare Benefits Schedule](http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/Home), which allows health care providers to bulk bill part of the cost of hearing services.

## **Research**

We fund research to improve hearing services and support in Australia.

  * We are providing grants for [research into developing and delivering improved hearing health support services](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/funding/find-funding/targeted-call-research-hearing-health-2021-evidence-based-support-services).
  * The [Medical Research Future Fund](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/medical-research-future-fund) funds research aimed at ending avoidable hearing loss in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.
  * The [National Acoustic Laboratories](https://www.nal.gov.au/) do research to improve hearing health, understand ways to effectively promote hearing health, explore early intervention methods, and find effective new technologies.

## **Who we work with**

We work with various stakeholders to help improve ear health and support
people experiencing hearing loss, including:

  * [state and territory governments](/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments "Local state and territory health departments") – manage hearing screening services
  * [Services Australia](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/) – delivers government payments and services
  * [National Disability Insurance Agency](https://www.ndis.gov.au/about-us) – manages the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which funds hearing supports for NDIS participants aged 26 and over who are not eligible for the [Hearing Services Program](https://hearingservices.gov.au/)
  * [Department of Veterans’ Affairs](https://www.dva.gov.au/health-and-treatment/injury-or-health-treatments/health-services/hearing-services) – provides veterans with hearing supports not already covered by the [Hearing Services Program](https://hearingservices.gov.au/)
  * [Therapeutic Goods Administration](https://tga-search.clients.funnelback.com/s/search.html?query=hearing&collection=tga-artg) – assesses, monitors and regulates hearing medical devices supplied in Australia
  * [Hearing Australia](https://www.hearing.com.au/) and [other hearing service providers](https://hearingservices.gov.au/wps/portal/hso/site/locateprovider/!ut/p/a1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOK9A03NDD0NjLwtwvzdDBwd_UJ9vNxMjAxcTIAKIvEoMDAlTr8BDuBoQEh_uH4UXiUgF4AV4LGiIDc0wiDTUREAHVWDDQ!!/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/) – provide hearing checks, hearing aids and ongoing care to eligible program participants.
