# Independent Review of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare

 __Page last updated: 19 February 2017

## Executive summary

Nous Group (Nous) was engaged by the Department of Health (DoH) to review the
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (the Institute). The Review
followed a sustained period of uncertainty about the future of the Institute,
change in the senior management team and uncertainty regarding membership of
the Institute Board. Recent Government decisions regarding the architecture of
health information agencies have resolved some of that uncertainty but the
salience of the Review remains high.

  
The environment within which the Institute works has changed radically over
recent years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) no longer restricts
itself to census and survey activity, increasing its activity in relation to
analysis of administrative data. Analysis within policy agencies has increased
with policy officers accessing data and analytics software to an unprecedented
extent. This raises fundamental questions about the role of the Institute into
the future. The Institute has both a challenge and opportunity to reposition
itself in the health and welfare information landscape. It no longer enjoys a
virtual monopoly on integrative analysis of survey and administrative data.  
  
To support consideration of the Institute’s optimal future contribution, Nous
reviewed its function at three levels: its role and purpose; its business
model, product range and funding model; and its internal governance and
organisation. To support this analysis Nous used our format for organisational
reviews, breaking each of these levels into constituent components. We
gathered evidence from approximately 40 interviews and 140 key documents and
validated preliminary findings with a Departmental reform management board and
the Institute’s Board and management team.  
  
The Institute is well positioned for its future in a number of key dimensions.
It is well respected for its independence and ethical frameworks, its
professional staff and the quality of its products. Stakeholders value each of
these features highly and do not want to see any changes that imperil these
qualities. It needs to be acknowledged also that many of the directions
recommended in the Review are in areas already the subject of work within the
Institute. Considerable effort and progress has been made in a number of
these. The Government decision to transfer the performance reporting role
currently performed by the National Health Performance Agency (NHPA) to the
Institute creates an opportunity decisively to build on this solid foundation.  
  
That said, the Review’s fundamental finding is that the Institute needs to
undertake a major organisational transformation program to reinstate full
stakeholder confidence and secure its future role as an indispensable,
internationally leading information agency in the health and welfare sector.
Elements of this transformation program include working proactively and
collaboratively with partners to refresh its charter, business models and
product range. A comprehensive set of recommendations are provided in the
following section.  
  
In order to support this transformation program a number of reforms are needed
within government departments and collectively by health and welfare
administrations. The budget for the Institute needs to move from being based
on 30% appropriated core funding (and 70% fee for service income) to at least
50%, preferably closer to 70%, appropriated funding. Funding departments need
to much better coordinate their engagement with the Institute and to
prioritise their requirements from increased appropriation funding. From a
whole of government perspective the Institute and Commonwealth departments
need to align the development of data sets, processes and trusted user
arrangements with developments underway across the Commonwealth. A review of
information plans across different sectors is also needed.  
  
Jurisdictions collectively, also need to engage at a more strategic level with
each other and then with the Institute regarding priorities. The Review noted
that this presents particular challenges in the welfare sector, with separate
welfare information coordination mechanisms now in place across different
aspects of the welfare spectrum – housing, community and disability services.
Jurisdictions – both Commonwealth and State and Territory – need to support
the optimal contribution of the Institute by improving the timeliness of data
provision and reconsidering the restrictive basis of data provision to the
Institute. Otherwise the Institute will not be able to meet the expectations
of jurisdictions for improved timeliness and salience of Institute products
and services.  
  
The Review was commissioned by the Commonwealth and, therefore, addresses its
recommendations to the Commonwealth. It recommends the Commonwealth provide
leadership by engaging with States and Territories to advocate these
collective improvements.  
  
Finally the Review team would like to acknowledge the high level of
cooperation and professionalism of the Institute staff and management as well
as that of the departmental staff and stakeholders with whom we have
interacted during the process.

## Conclusions and recommendations

The Review concludes that:

  
The Institute must undertake a major organisational transformation program to
reinstate full stakeholder confidence and secure its future role as an
indispensable, internationally leading information organisation in the health
and welfare sector.  
  
Specifically, the organisational transformation program must ensure that the
Institute effectively, and without disruption, continues the functions
transferred from NHPA. The transformation must take into account the
fundamental differences between the current work of the AIHW and that of the
NHPA and the implications this will have for governance, data access, internal
processes and external relationships.  
We have identified the key elements to deliver the transformation in the
following recommendations.  
  

### Key recommendations – Key line of enquiry 1

What opportunities exist to enhance the Institute’s role as a provider of
whole-of-system health and welfare information, analysis and statistics?
(Future purpose and strategy)  

#### Future role

 **R1.** The Institute’s Board, in consultation with all its stakeholders,
should establish a charter for the Institute’s enhanced international and
national role and for the value it offers the nation.  
**R2.** The Institute should provide Government, within one year, with a five
year strategy to fulfil its Charter.  
**R3.** The Institute should re-launch itself to reflect a refreshed charter,
strategy and communications approach.  

### Key recommendations – Key line of enquiry 2

#### Products and services

 **R4.** The Institute should, within one year, conduct a full stocktake of
its products and services, and the NHPA products and services it will acquire,
to rationalise, modernise and digitise its product suite.  
**R5.** The Institute should continue to produce Australia’s health and
Australia’s welfare reporting and continue the NHPA health system performance
reporting conducted under the Performance Accountability Framework (pending
the outcomes of the current review of the framework).  
**R6.** The Institute should develop a new service offering that provides well
organised data and structured training to clients.  
**R7.** The Commonwealth should work with states, territories and other
stakeholders to modernise Australia’s health performance frameworks to support
a whole-of-system approach to performance analysis, monitoring and reporting.  
**R8.** The Commonwealth, with jurisdictions, should develop agreed roles and
responsibilities for health and hospital classifications to remove
duplication.  
**R9.** The Institute should identify, in consultation with jurisdictions, new
and priority health and welfare data linkage projects to better inform public
policy and service redesign.  

#### Funding model

 **R10.** The Commonwealth should implement a revised funding structure for
the Institute, which facilitates a more strategic, long-term and flexible
approach to its priorities and work program.  
**R11.** The Institute should develop a financial strategy, a published
pricing policy and a process for prioritisation and signoff of commissioned
work by the Commonwealth and jurisdictions. The pricing policy should be more
transparent about relationship to cost.  
**R12.** DoH and DSS should establish a new governance and coordination
mechanism for DoH and DSS to manage the development, implementation and
monitoring of the work program funded by the Departments (including a single
coordination point).  

### Key recommendations – Key line of enquiry 3

What organisation design will most efficiently and effectively support the
Institute’s future purpose, strategy and business model?  

#### External alliances

 **R13.** The Institute should establish a multilateral collaboration
arrangement with the ABS, ACSQHC, IHPA and the Productivity Commission for
RoGS to eliminate duplication and drive opportunities for cooperation.  
**R14.** The Institute should prioritise its partnerships (current and future)
and identify how key partnerships will be developed and maintained for
strategic purposes.  
**R15.** The Institute and the jurisdictions should define their respective
roles and responsibilities in relation to the implementation of existing sub-
jurisdictional performance reporting agreements.  

#### Processes

 **R16.** The Institute should ensure business continuity of all processes
related to the delivery of NHPA products and services, including performance
reporting.  
**R17.** The Institute, in collaboration with data providers, should ensure
its data collection and linkage processes promote ‘single provision, multiple
use’.  
**R18.** The Institute should reform its report production process to allow
for more timely release of products.  
**R19.** The Institute should establish regular evaluations of its products
and services including customer satisfaction measures.  
**R20.** The Institute should continue to reform its project management
framework.  

#### Workforce

 **R21.** The Institute should develop, attract, recruit and retain critical
capabilities, especially in relation to ‘cutting edge’ data modelling and
analysis, performance reporting, communications, and transformation.  

#### Culture

 **R22.** The Institute should build on its internal culture, and that of
NHPA, to develop clear values and behaviours for staff engagement outside the
organisation.  

#### Office space

 **R23.** DoH should determine the long term forward plan for office
accommodation in Sydney, in consultation with the Institute and NHPA.  

#### Structure and functions

 **R24.** The Institute should revise its structure to accommodate the
transfer of NHPA functions and be consistent with agreed design criteria.  
**R25.** The Institute should actively look for opportunities to share
corporate services with DoH and other agencies as appropriate.  

#### Information management

 **R26.** The Institute should accelerate the upgrade of METeOR.  
**R27.** The Institute should expand membership of Validata to increase the
quality of data collection in Australia.  
**R28.** The Institute should ensure continuity of NHPA information systems
and data supply and additionally draw on NHPA’s expertise to accelerate and
automate data analysis and report production.  
**R29.** In consultation with the Institute, DoH should implement full access
to MBS and PBS data as soon as practical in order to identify trends and
correlations across health and welfare data sets.  

#### Governance

 **R30.** DoH and DSS, through the relevant ministerial councils, should each
establish strategic information planning and funding structures to better
direct the Institute’s work program.  
**R31.** The Institute should rationalise and align all their advisory
committees with the forward work program.  
**R32.** The Commonwealth should urgently move to fill current and soon to be
vacant Board positions to ensure leadership stability for the Institute.  
**R33.** DoH and the Institute should urgently move to fill current and soon
to be vacant Executive positions to ensure leadership stability for the
Institute.  
**R34.** The Commonwealth should develop an improved governance model for the
Institute which reflects the new NHPA functions, a smaller, skills-based
rather than representative Board, longer term Board appointments and a clearer
definition of the role and responsibility of each Board member.  
**R35.** The Commonwealth should propose the necessary amendments to the
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Act 1987 (Cth) to implement the
revised arrangements and functions.
