During the [MBS Review](/our-work/mbs-review "Medicare Benefits Schedule
\(MBS\) Review "), clinical committees and working groups across medical
specialties:

  * developed reports reviewing specific MBS items
  * asked stakeholders to provide feedback on their reports
  * incorporated stakeholder feedback
  * sent their final report to the [MBS Review Taskforce](/committees-and-groups/mbs-review-taskforce "Medicare Benefits Schedule \(MBS\) Review Taskforce") for consideration. 

This collection contains links to the final clinical committee and working
group reports that were presented to the taskforce for endorsement following
stakeholder consultation.

committees](node/22690#clinical-committees).

Taskforce](/resources/collections/mbs-review-final-taskforce-reports-findings-
