Until 30 September 2022, Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item 61644 is
available as a direct substitute for MBS item 61325. Item 61325 cannot be used
due to a supply shortage of thallium-201.

The new MBS item ensures cardiac viability testing can continue for patients
who need it.

Read the [fact sheet](/resources/publications/substitute-positron-emission-
tomography-pet-item-for-use-during-thallium-201-supply-shortage "Substitute
positron emission tomography \(PET\) item for use during thallium-201 supply
shortage") for more information.
