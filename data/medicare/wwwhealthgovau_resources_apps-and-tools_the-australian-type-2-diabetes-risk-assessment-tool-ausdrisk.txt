The Australian type 2 diabetes risk assessment tool (AUSDRISK) is a short list
of questions. It helps both health professionals and individuals to assess the
risk of a person developing type 2 diabetes over the next 5 years.

You can complete AUSDRISK by yourself, or with the help of a health
professional or practice nurse.

You can complete the tool in 1 of 3 ways:

  * using the online [interactive version](/node/14547) (click **Start now** button below) 
  * using the [online non-interactive version](/resources/apps-and-tools/the-australian-type-2-diabetes-risk-assessment-tool-ausdrisk/the-australian-type-2-diabetes-risk-assessment-tool-ausdrisk-non-interactive "The Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool \(AUSDRISK\) – non-interactive")
  * downloading the [pdf version](/resources/publications/the-australian-type-2-diabetes-risk-assessment-tool-ausdrisk-pdf-version "The Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool \(AUSDRISK\) – PDF version") and completing it on paper.

To order hard copies of this tool, [contact National Mailing and
Marketing](/contacts/national-mailing-and-marketing-contact "National Mailing
and Marketing contact"). The code for this publication is DR001.

If you get a 'high' score on AUSDRISK, you are eligible to attend a type 2
diabetes risk evaluation by your GP if you are aged:

  * 40 to 49 years (inclusive). Read more at [Health assessment for people aged 40 to 49 years with a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mbsprimarycare_mbsitem_type2diabetes)
