## **Accessing Medicare benefits**

The conditions that allow doctors to access Medicare benefits under section
19AA of the [Health Insurance Act
1973](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2021C00285) depend on:

  * their residency status
  * whether they are vocationally recognised (that is, hold fellowship qualifications from a recognised Australian specialist college).

Section 19AA applies to every doctor who registered to practise medicine in
Australia on or after 1 November 1996. No exemption is available for any
reason. ****

### **Permanent residents or citizens**

If you are a permanent resident or citizen of Australia, you must have a
fellowship with:

  * the [Royal Australian College of General Practitioners](https://www.racgp.org.au/)
  * the [Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine](https://www.acrrm.org.au/)
  * an [Australian specialist college](https://www.amc.org.au/accreditation-and-recognition/assessment-accreditation-specialist-medical-programs-assessment-accreditation-specialist-medical-programs/specialist-medical-colleges/).

If you don’t, you must be on an approved training program and working towards
attaining fellowship.

If you are an overseas trained doctor or foreign graduate of an accredited
medical school, you will be subject to a [10-year moratorium](/topics/doctors-
and-specialists/what-we-do/19ab/moratorium "10-year moratorium and scaling").
This means that for 10 years, you can access Medicare benefits only if you
work in certain locations and meet eligibility requirements under [section
19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973](/topics/medicare/access-practitioners-
industry/doctors-and-specialists/19ab "Section 19AB restricted doctors and
access to Medicare").

### **Temporary residents**

If you are an overseas trained doctor or foreign graduate of an accredited
medical school who is a temporary resident of Australia, you must satisfy
section 19AB. This applies whether you are vocationally recognised or not.

#### Gaining permanent residency before vocational recognition

Your Medicare access will cease if you become a permanent resident before you
gain vocational recognition and are not taking part in an approved program.

Let [Services
Australia](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/health-
professionals/health-professionals-contact-information) know of any change in
your residency as soon as it occurs to avoid accruing a debt.

To regain Medicare access, you will need to join an approved program at an
eligible location.

## **Workforce and training programs for those without fellowship**

From January 2022, if you are a general practitioner and wish to sit your
fellowship examination, you must be participating on a college-led training
program. These programs are:

  * [Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine Independent Pathway](https://www.acrrm.org.au/training-towards-fellowship/overview-of-fellowship-training/training-pathways/acrrm-independent-pathway)
  * [Australian General Practice Training Program](/our-work/australian-general-practice-training-agpt-program "Australian General Practice Training \(AGPT\) Program")
  * [Remote Vocational Training Scheme](https://rvts.org.au/)
  * [Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Practice Experience Program](https://www.racgp.org.au/education/imgs/fellowship-pathways/fellowship-programs-for-imgs/practice-experience-program).

If you are training in a specialty other than general practice, you should
speak to your college about approved fellowship pathways.

If you do not have fellowship, you can access Medicare benefits only if you
are on an approved training or workforce program at an eligible location.
These programs are available for a defined period, and you will not be able to
sit your fellowship exams while you remain on these programs:

  * [Approved Medical Deputising Services Program](/our-work/amds "Approved Medical Deputising Services \(AMDS\) program")
  * [More Doctors for Rural Australia Program](/our-work/more-doctors-for-rural-australia-program "More Doctors for Rural Australia Program").

The following programs are closed to new applicants. Current participants on
these programs can access Medicare benefits for the remainder of their
placement, but will be unable to sit their fellowship exams while they remain
on these programs:

  * [Rural Locum Relief Program](http://www.rhwa.org.au/rural-locum-relief-program)
  * [Special Approved Placements Program](/our-work/sapp "Special Approved Placements Program \(SAPP\)")
  * [Temporary Residents Other Medical Practitioners Program](/our-work/TROMPs "Temporary Resident Other Medical Practitioners program").

## **Why gaining fellowship is important**

Having a fellowship ensures:

  * you qualify for full Medicare benefits access
  * Australians have access to highly qualified medical practitioners.

## **Processing timeframes**

December to March is our peak processing period for Medicare provider number
applications. During this time, allow a minimum of 6 weeks for your
application to be processed and a Medicare provider number issued.
