## Lifetime Health Cover calculator

This calculator will provide you with information about your [Lifetime Health
Cover](/health_insurance/surcharges_incentives/lifetime_health_cover.htm
"Lifetime Health Cover") (LHC) base day and loading based on the provisions of
the _Private Health Insurance Act 2007_ which commenced on 1 April 2007. If
you had hospital cover on 31 March 2007 and that cover is continuing, your LHC
loading, if any, is based on the previous legislation. Your health insurer can
provide you with details of that loading.

If you are covered under a couples or family policy you will need to complete
the calculator separately for each individual adult covered by that policy.
The LHC loading for a couple or family is calculated by using the average of
the LHC loadings of the adults covered by the policy.

You may require the following information to complete the Lifetime Health
Cover Calculator:

  *  **Periods of hospital cover** – Records of any periods during which you held private health insurance hospital cover or had your hospital cover suspended by your insurer. You can obtain this information from the relevant health insurance fund.  
Overseas visitors cover, overseas students cover, travel insurance and health
cover that is provided by an international policy are not considered as
complying hospital cover for the purposes of Lifetime Health Cover.

  *  **Time overseas** – The dates of any periods where you were overseas for more than 12 months. You can obtain a copy of your _international movement record_ ([[Request for international movement records](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/departmental-forms/online-forms/request-international-movement-records "Link - Department of Home Affairs - Request for international movement records")](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/departmental-forms/online-forms/request-international-movement-records "Request for international movement record")) from the [Department of Home Affairs](http://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/ "Department of Home Affairs").
  *  **Alternative cover** – records for any periods where you had your health care covered by the Australian Defence Forces, the Antarctic Division or under a Department of Veterans’ Affairs Gold Card.
  *  **Medicare registration** – If you have recently migrated to Australia you will need details of your registration with Medicare Australia. You can obtain a copy of your _Medicare eligibility letter_ from Medicare Australia.
