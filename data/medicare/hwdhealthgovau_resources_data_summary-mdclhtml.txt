# Summary Statistics, Medical Profession

Summary tables were generated using a statistical package that uses different
rounding methodologies to the Health Workforce Data Tool. Percentages and/or
averages may differ slightly to those extracted from the Health Workforce Data
Tool.

### Registered and Employed in Australia 2017 to 2021

#### Interpreting 2021 Medical Practitioner data

From 16 June 2021, Services Australia started using the Australian Health
Practitioner Regulation Agencyâs (Ahpra) Register of practitioners to
confirm General Practitioners (GPs) specialist registration, required so their
patients were eligible to retain access to Medicare Rebates. This change saw a
significant short-term increase in medical specialist applications from GPs.
Please note that this change in registration practice does not represent an
additional GP workforce and care should be taken when comparing figures
between 2020 and 2021.
