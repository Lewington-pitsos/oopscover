## Product tiers

Four new tiers of hospital cover began rolling out from early 2019 and became
mandatory from 1 April 2020. All hospital insurance policies are classified as
Gold, Silver, Bronze or Basic.Â

In order to be classified in a tier, the policy has to meet the minimum
requirements of that tier - it must include all the required Clinical
Categories for its tier. Each Clinical Category is a group of hospital
treatments - for example,Â âbone, joint and muscleâ or âheart and
vascular systemâ.

As part of various [private health insurance
changes](/health_insurance/phichanges/index.htm "Changes to private health
insurance"), four new tiers of hospital cover began rolling out from 1 April
2019 and became mandatory from 1 April 2020. All hospital insurance policies
are classified as Gold, Silver, Bronze or Basic.Â

### Gold, Silver, Bronze and Basic hospital tiers

In order to be classified in a tier, the policy has to meet the minimum
requirements of that tier as set out in the table below. All treatments in the
table below refer to treatment received as part of a hospital admission.

Each of the clinical categories listed below are groups of what hospital
treatments are, and are not, covered under each policy.

If a policy meets the minimum requirements of a tier, but also includes
additional coverage, then it can be called a âPlusâ policy â for
example, Bronze Plus or Silver Plus.

### Clinical categories

Each standard categoryâfor example, âbone, joint and muscleâ category or
âheart and vascular systemâ categoryâsets out the hospital treatments
that must be covered by your private health insurer. If a policy covers a
certain category, then it must cover everything listed in itânot only some
things.

### Receiving treatment for complications and unplanned hospital treatment  

#### Complications

If you are admitted to hospital for a planned treatment which is included in
your policy and complications arise which are outside the scope of your
policy, then your insurer is required to cover the treatment of the
complication. For example, if a person has surgery for a digestive illness and
they develop acute arrhythmia during the episode of hospital treatment,
treatment by a cardiologist and cardioversion would be covered even if the
personâs policy did not otherwise cover the Heart and vascular system
clinical category.

#### Unplanned treatment

If you are admitted to hospital for a planned treatment included in your
policy, and your doctor finds during the admission you have another condition
requiring urgent treatment, this âassociated unplanned treatmentâ must be
covered by the insurer regardless of whether treatment is within the scope of
your policy.Â Insurers are required to cover an associated unplanned treatment
which is not otherwise included in a policy where the treatment is provided
within the same episode of care as the original treatment. The associated
unplanned treatment must be considered medically urgent and necessary in the
view of the medical practitioner providing the treatment.  

### Two or more procedures where one is excluded from your policy

Insurers are required to cover elective procedures that are covered by your
policy, and all associated services or complications arising from that
procedure.

However, your insurer does not have to cover any planned elective procedures
not covered by your policy, even if it is provided in the same admission.

For example, a patient with a Bronze policy has elective surgery for the
removal of their tonsils and also elects to have dental surgery in the same
admission; their policy only covers the tonsillectomy and not the dental
surgery. Their insurer is only required to cover the tonsillectomy and
associated services such as post-operative care for the tonsillectomy.

### Hospital treatment product tiers
