###  New or Relocating pharmacy

Pharmacists must apply to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged
Care under [section
90](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nha1953147/s90.html) of
the _[National Health Act 1953
(Act)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1953A00095) _ to seek approval
to:

  * supply Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines at new pharmacy premises; or
  * relocate an existing pharmacy that is approved to supply PBS medicines to other premises.

Applications are considered by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority
(ACPA) which makes a recommendation to the Secretary. Before applying please
see the:

  * [Pharmacy Location Rules](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms); and
  * [Pharmacy Location Rules - Applicant's Handbook](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms).

To apply for approval to establish a new pharmacy, or to relocate an existing
pharmacy, the pharmacist will need to:

  * determine which Item of the [Pharmacy Location Rules](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms) to apply under;
  * access the [PBS Approved Suppliers Porta](https://pbsapprovedsuppliers.health.gov.au/)l to lodge an application (please note, [Terms of Use](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-terms-of-use-for-pharmacy-approvals-portal) must be agreed to access the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal); and
  * provide relevant information to support the application. Guides for submitting an application to establish a new pharmacy, see [Guides and Forms](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms). To view the end-to-end process for a new or relocating pharmacy application, see the [ACPA application process map](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms).

If an application is recommended, prior to delegate approval, the applicant
will need to provide evidence that the requirements of the relevant state or
territory regulatory authority to operate a pharmacy business at the proposed
premises, have been met.

### Pharmacy Location Rules

The Rules relate to the establishment of a new pharmacy or the relocation of
an existing pharmacy which has approval to provide PBS medicines under section
90 of the _Act._  
  
The Rules are legislated under the [National Health (Australian Community
Pharmacy Authority Rules) Determination
2018](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2018L01321) made under section
99L of the Act.  
  
The Rules set out location-based criteria which must be met in order for the
ACPA to recommend approval of a pharmacist. The ACPA cannot override the
requirements of the Rules and can only recommend that an application be
approved if it is satisfied that all of the requirements of the item, under
which the application was made, have been met.  
  
The Rules remain consistent with the overall objective of the National
Medicines Policy to improve the health outcomes of all Australians through
access to and quality use of medicines.  
  
Applicants wishing to lodge an application for consideration under the Rules,
are required to lodge the application with the Department of Health and Aged
Care, via the [PBS Approved Suppliers
Portal](https://pbsapprovedsuppliers.health.gov.au/).  
  

Before lodging an application, please consult the [Pharmacy Location Rules â€“
Applicantâ€™s
Handbook](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-
pbs-general-pharmacy-acpa-acpaintro.htm) which provides you with information
you will need to prepare an application.

  

### Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (ACPA)

The ACPA is an independent statutory authority established under section 99J
of the Act.  
  
The ACPA has six part-time members, five of whom are appointed by the Minister
and one appointed by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged Care
(Secretary).  
  
The ACPA considers applications for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits
under section 90 of the Act and makes recommendations to delegated officers as
to whether or not an application should be approved.  
  
In making its recommendation to the Secretaryâ€™s delegate, the ACPA must comply
with the requirements specified in the [Rules as determined by the
Minister](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2018L01321). The ACPA can
only make a recommendation that an application be approved if it finds that
all of the relevant requirements of the Rules are met.  
  
**Applications for approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits under section 90
of the _Act_**  
The _[Pharmacy Location Rules â€“ Applicantâ€™s
Handbook](http://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-
pbs-general-pharmacy-acpa-acpaintro.htm)_ provides pharmacists with
comprehensive information about:

    * the Rules and the ACPA; 
    * the application process including the requirements that must be satisfied and the types of information that must be included in an application; and 
    * seeking further information or assistance. 

It is up to the applicant to select the item which best suits their situation
as each item has different requirements. Applicants must satisfy all of the
requirements for a particular item if they are to receive a recommendation for
approval from the ACPA.  
  
Applications and associated forms must be lodged via the [PBS Approved
Suppliers Portal](https://pbsapprovedsuppliers.health.gov.au/). Further
information is available from the Department of Health and Aged Care website
at [How to apply to become a PBS approved supplier â€“ information for
pharmacists](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/pharmacists).
If you require further assistance, please call PBS Approved Suppliers on 1800
316 389.  

### ACPA Meeting dates

The ACPA meeting dates for the remainder of 2022 and for 2023, and the
corresponding application lodgement timeframes for complete applications to be
received by the Department of Health and Aged Care via the PBS Approved
Suppliers Portal, are outlined in the table below.

Please note the longer timeframe between the December meeting and the first
meeting in the following year, to account for the Department of Health and
Aged Careâ€™s closure over Christmas, and availability of staff and members of
the ACPA in January.

These dates are subject to change and are current as at 18 October 2022.

Note: Application lodgement timeframes are to ensure that the Department of
Health and Aged Care and the ACPA Secretariat have sufficient time to process
and register applications (subject to the application being valid), undertake
consultation with third parties where relevant and for the ACPA to give proper
consideration of applications.

### Notification of ACPA meeting outcomes

Meeting outcomes will be published on the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal within
five working days after a meeting.

The Secretaryâ€™s delegate in the Department of Health and Aged Care will be
provided with the decisions of the Authority where a recommendation to approve
or not approve an application has been made.

### ACPA recommends that an application be approved

If the recommendation by the Authority is to approve an application, the
relevant delegate in the Department of Health and Aged Care is responsible for
granting the approval. However, the delegate may also reject the application
even if approval has been recommended by the ACPA.

Once a recommendation to approve an application has been published on the [PBS
Approved Suppliers Portal](https://pbsapprovedsuppliers.health.gov.au/), the
Department of Health and Aged Care will write to recommended applicants to
advise of the decision and outline the requirements for obtaining approval.

### ACPA recommends that an application not be approved

If the ACPA has made a decision to recommend that an application not be
approved, it will endeavour to inform the applicant of the decision, including
the reason(s) for the decision and the rights of review, **within ten working
days** after the meeting.

### ACPA defers making a recommendation on an application

If the ACPA defers consideration of the application to the next meeting, the
Secretariat will endeavour to advise the applicant of the reasons for the
deferral **within five working days** after the meeting and the status
â€˜Deferredâ€™ will be displayed on the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal.

### Surrounding pharmacists who provided comments on an application

The ACPA will endeavour to advise the outcome of an application to any
pharmacist/s who provided comments to the ACPA, as soon as practicable, but
generally no sooner than **ten working days** after a meeting. Please note
that the ACPA does not advise surrounding pharmacists of the meeting outcome
if the ACPA has deferred making a recommendation.

### How do I contact the ACPA?

For any queries, please email details of your enquiry to
[acpamail@health.gov.au](mailto:acpamail@health.gov.au) or call the PBS
Approved Suppliers Information Line on 1800 316 389.
