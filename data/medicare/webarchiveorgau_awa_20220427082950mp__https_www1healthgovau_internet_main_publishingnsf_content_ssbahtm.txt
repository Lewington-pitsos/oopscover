# Security Sensitive Biological Agents

This website provides information about the Security Sensitive Biological
Agents (SSBA) Regulatory Scheme.

 __Page last updated: 25 August 2020

The deliberate release of harmful biological agents such as viruses, bacteria,
fungi and toxins has the potential to cause significant damage to human
health, the environment and the Australian economy.

In 2006, the Council of Australian Governments’ (COAG) Report on the
Regulation and Control of Biological Agents identified that the regulations in
place at the time focused on safety rather than security; and that there was a
need to regulate the secure storage, possession, use and transport of security
sensitive biological agents to minimise the risk of use for terrorism or
criminal purposes.

The aim of the SSBA Regulatory Scheme is to limit the opportunities for acts
of bioterrorism or biocrime to occur using harmful biological agents and to
provide a legislative framework for managing the security of SSBAs. The scheme
was developed using risk management principles to achieve a balance between
counter-terrorism concerns and the interests of the regulated community and
aims to maintain full access to SSBAs for those with a legitimate need. The
SSBA Regulatory Scheme also builds on Australia's obligations under the
Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention and UN Security Council Resolution
1540.

The SSBA Scheme can be contacted on 02 6289 7477 or by email at
[ssba](mailto:ssba@health.gov.au). For postal addresses please see the
[Contact SSBA Regulatory
Scheme](/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ssba.htm#contact).

## What's New (October 2019)

### Hot Issues

#### Handling suspected or confirmed _African swine fever virus_ under the
SSBA Regulatory Scheme

In light of the changing distribution of _African swine fever virus_ (ASFV) in
the region, laboratories that would not usually screen for or handle ASFV may
be required to test specimen samples that could contain the disease.

ASFV is a Tier 2 SSBA regulated by the Australian Government Department of
Health. Handling and reporting obligations for ASFV differ depending on
whether an entity is registered under the SSBA Regulatory Scheme or not.

#### Non-registered entities

Non-registered entities that handle suspected or confirmed ASFV must comply
with Parts 9, 9A and/or 10 of the SSBA Standards as applicable, and report
handling information, including the outcome of testing results, to the
Department of Health through submission of a [Non-Registered Facility Report
for Suspected SSBAs and Confirmatory Testing Results
form](/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/ssba-
reporting-forms#08). Non-registered entities are encouraged to familiarise
themselves with the requirements of the SSBA Regulatory Scheme for handling
ASFV on the [SSBA Regulatory Scheme
website](/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ssba.htm?Open=&utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=digital_transformation&utm_content=ssba).

[Guideline 3: Handling a Person or Animal, or Samples from a Person or Animal,
Affected by an
SSBA](/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ssba-
guidelines.htm#03) also assists in further describing the requirements for
handling a person or animal, or samples from a person or animal, affected by
an SSBA.

Please note, when required, reports must be submitted to the Department of
Health as soon as possible and within two business days after you form the
suspicion on the basis of your usual laboratory testing that you are handling
a suspected SSBA.

####  Registered entities

Entities registered to handle ASFV on an ongoing basis must comply with Parts
1-8 (and Part 11 if applicable) of the SSBA Standards and are subject to a
scheduled monitoring and compliance program. Registered entities are not
required to report the outcome of testing results to the Department of Health
after each occurrence, although need to ensure compliance with record keeping
requirements under the SSBA Standards.

If you would like assistance with the reporting process and handling
requirements, please email [ssba@health.gov.au](mailto:ssba@health.gov.au) or
call (02) 6289 7477 during business hours.

## The _National Health Security Act 2007_

Part 3 of the National Health Security Act 2007 establishes the regulatory
scheme for entities and facilities that handle suspected or known SSBAs.

The NHS Act was amended in 2013 and these amendments came into force on 31
March 2013. A new _Fact Sheet 17 – Changes to the National Health Security
Legislation_ outlines the changes and is available here.

The _National Health Security Act 2007_ legislates the regulatory scheme and
can be found at ComLaw, Commonwealth of Australia Law website: - [National
Health Security Act
2007](https://web.archive.org.au/awa/20220427082950mp_/http://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013C00147)

## The _National Health Security Regulations 2018_

The _National Health Security Regulations 2018_ (NHS Regulations) support the
_National Health Security Act 2007_ by providing operational detail about the
SSBA Regulatory Scheme.

The _NHS Regulations 2008_ sunsetted on 1 October 2018 and were replaced with
the (current) _NHS Regulations 2018._ There were minor administrative
amendments to the regulations.

The NHS Regulations can be found at the ComLaw, Commonwealth of Australia Law
website.

[The National Health Security Regulations
2018](https://web.archive.org.au/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2018L01247)

## List of SSBAs

On 10 November 2008 the Minister established the List of SSBAs under Part 3 of
the _National Health Security Act 2007_. The regulation of Tier 1 agents
commenced on 31 January 2009 and the regulation of Tier 2 agents commenced on
31 January 2010.

Tier 1 agents are those that pose the highest security risk to Australia,
while Tier 2 agents pose a high security risk.

(www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2013L01065)

## SSBA Regulatory Scheme Inspection Program

The SSBA Regulatory Scheme Inspection Program commenced in August 2009. SSBA
Inspectors are provided by the Office of Gene Technology Regulator and are
appointed by the Secretary of the Department of Health.

All facilities will be inspected within the first 12 months of registration.
After this initial inspection, registered facilities handling Tier 1 SSBAs
will be inspected every 18 months and registered facilities handling Tier 2
SSBAs will be inspected every two years. Non-registered facilities will be
inspected on an as needed basis. Spot checks of registered and non-registered
facilities may occur at any time.

### Comprehensive and Mid-cycle Inspections

Initial Inspections are Comprehensive Inspections that cover all parts of the
SSBA Standards and are carried out over two days. Provided a high level of
compliance is achieved, the next inspection will be a Mid-cycle Inspection
that specifically covers the previous inspection outcomes, any changes to the
SSBA Regulatory Scheme or any alterations to the facility’s secure areas or
processes. Mini Inspections are usually carried out over one day. Subsequent
inspections will alternate between a Comprehensive (two day) Inspection and a
Mid-cycle Inspection.

### Spot checks and Desktop inspections

In 2012, the SSBA Regulatory Scheme introduced spot checks and desktop
inspections.

Spot checks are a subset of routine monitoring and may also be conducted as
part of follow-up reviews and focus on the outcome of previous inspections.
Spot checks are conducted with 24 hours notice to a facility to ensure
security requirements can be met and involve a physical inspection of the
facility and review of records and interviews with staff. This type of
inspection can be conducted on registered or non-registered facilities.

Desktop inspections were introduced in June 2012 to complement the physical
inspection program. Desktop inspections are a paper-based assessment of a
facility’s compliance with the SSBA Standards and require no on-site
assessment of activities. The assessment can be against the complete SSBA
Standards or a specific part or clause of the Standards. It can also assess a
specific area of regulatory compliance, such as reporting requirements. A
desktop inspection will comprise liaison with the Responsible or Contact
Officers of a facility to make arrangements for the submission of the
documented evidence required for the desktop inspection, a review of the
paper-based records supplied by the facility and confirmation of the outcome
of the desktop inspection.

Further information on the SSBA Regulatory Scheme Inspections is contained in
Guideline 10 – SSBA Regulatory Scheme Monitoring Inspections (available from
the SSBA Guidelines section of this website).

## SSBA Guidelines

The [SSBA
Guidelines](/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ssba-
guidelines.htm) have been developed to support the SSBA Regulatory Scheme.
Stakeholders are welcome to suggest areas of interest that may warrant the
development of further Guidelines. Suggestions may be sent to
[ssba](mailto:ssba@health.gov.au) for consideration.

## SSBA Fact Sheets

The purpose of the [SSBA Fact
Sheets](/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ssba-
factsheets.htm) is to support the education and awareness of the SSBA
Regulatory Scheme and provide information to stakeholders on topics of
particular interest. Stakeholders are welcome to suggest areas of interest
that may warrant the development of further Fact Sheets. Suggestions may be
sent to [ssba](mailto:ssba@health.gov.au) for consideration.

Please note that the SSBA Fact Sheets are currently being updated to reflect
the changes to the SSBA Standards. Entities will be notified once the new Fact
Sheets are available.

## Reporting Forms

The [SSBA Reporting
Forms](/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/ssba-
reporting-forms) allow entities and facilities to report to the Department of
Health details of reportable events in relation to the handling of SSBAs. The
first report (Initial Registration or Non-Registered Facility Report) is
required to be submitted by a paper-based report and must be sent to the
Department by Australia Post’s registered post service or courier. The
addresses for postal reports can be found under the Contact SSBA Regulatory
Scheme section.

Where possible, it is recommended that all other reports are submitted using
the online Data Collection System (DCS). DCS access will be granted to the
facility following the first submission of a paper-based report. If you have
forgotten your user details please email a request to
[ssba](mailto:ssba@health.gov.au).

## Entity and Facility Specific Training Template

This document has been produced to assist entities to meet the entity and
facility specific training requirement under clause 3.9.1 of the SSBA
Standards.

A PowerPoint presentation has been developed to align with the relevant
clauses in the SSBA Standards that may require training for staff on
entity/facility specific policies and procedures. A section has also been
included on reporting to the SSBA Regulatory Scheme.

The slides have been broken into sections with each section covering one Part
of the SSBA Standards and entities are encouraged to add or remove slides as
needed. As the overall presentation is quite lengthy, trainers are encouraged
to consider using each section or a group of sections as an individual module
for training purposes and to allow training to be tailored to specific
audiences – for example you may wish to include different information when
training laboratory staff than that provided to staff who are only accessing
sensitive information (such as IT personnel).

The use of this document is not mandatory and entities may use other training
packages if preferred.

A copy of the Training Template PowerPoint is available by emailing the [SSBA
Regulatory Scheme](mailto:ssba@health.gov.au).

## Security Risk Template

The Security Risk Template (SRT) was developed as a tool to assist the
regulated community to ensure that all risks associated with handing SSBAs
have been identified and treated. Following feedback from the regulated
community, the SRT has been revised to harmonise with current security risk
management frameworks.

The new SRT (Version 1 – February 2011) has a new format and has been designed
to meet the requirements of Part 2 of the SSBA Standards dealing with the risk
assessment and risk management plans.

The use of the revised SRT is not mandatory and entities and facilities may
choose to use other means to assist with risk assessment and risk management.

The SRT will no longer be able to be used as a checklist to monitor compliance
with the SSBA Standards. In order to assist entities to do this, an Internal
Review Tool has been developed.

## Internal Review Tool

The Internal Review Tool (IRT) has been developed to assist entities and
facilities to monitor compliance with the SSBA Standards. The IRT has a series
of questions based on the requirements of the SSBA Standards with a simple
check box system of Yes/No and comments, and each section also includes
questions about recommended practices and procedures.

The use of the IRT is not mandatory and entities and facilities may choose to
use other means to assist with compliance management.

## SSBA Regulator Scheme 2015-16 Self Assessment Report under the Regulator
Performance Framework

Under the Australian Government Regulator Performance Framework (RPF) the
Department of Health is responsible for ensuring that regulators within its
portfolio, who meet defined criteria, complete an annual externally validated
self-assessment report. The report considers the [self-assessment of the
Security Sensitive Biological Agents (SSBA) Regulatory Scheme, describes the
intention of the annual self-assessment process and presents the results for
2015-16](/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/RPT-
self-assessment).

A number of measures and evidence metrics were formulated, pre-agreed and
published on the Health website in July 2015 to describe how the SSBA
Regulatory Scheme would meet each of the Key Performance Indicators. The
[Regulatory Performance Framework webpage outlines the aims, processes and
metrics](/awa/20220427082950mp_/https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/RPF-
and-International+Standards).

Overall, the SSBA Regulatory Scheme considered that a high level of
performance was achieved and an overall rating of ‘very good’ was determined.
This rating was strongly supported by the Public Health Laboratory Network
(PHLN) Executive Group that was appointed as the external stakeholder
validation mechanism by the Minister for Health.
