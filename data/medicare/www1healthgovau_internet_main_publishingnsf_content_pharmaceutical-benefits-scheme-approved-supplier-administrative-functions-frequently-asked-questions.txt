### Application Fees and payment

**Why were pharmacy approval application fees introduced?**

In the 2018-19 Budget, the Government announced its decision to fully recover
costs for the pharmacy approval process.

**When were the application fees introduced?**

Application fees were introduced commencing 1 July 2020. Pharmacy approval
applications submitted on or after this date will incur a fee.

**Which application types will incur an application fee?**

From 1 July 2020, application fees will apply to:

  * applications assessed by the ACPA for approval to: 
    * establish a new pharmacy to supply pharmaceutical benefits, and 
    * relocate an approved pharmacy (with or without change of ownership).

  * applications assessed by the Department of Health and Aged Care for approval to: 
    * change ownership of an approved pharmacy (not involving relocation), and 
    * expand or contract the size of an approved pharmacy.

For details about the current application fee levels, refer to the information
provided at [PBS Approved Supplier Application Fee](pharmaceutical-benefits-
scheme-approved-supplier-application-fees)s.

**How are the pharmacy approval application fees set?**

The approach used to determine the costs of this regulatory charging activity
is an Activity-Based Costing (ABC) methodology for the allocation of all
direct and indirect costs to the pharmacy approval activities. Direct and
indirect costs are estimated based on the average time required to assess one
application.

Further information is available from [The Cost Recovery Implementation
Statement: Approval process for pharmacists seeking to provide Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme medicines
2022-23](/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-
approved-supplier-application-fees)

**How do I pay the application fee?**

After lodging your application you will be prompted to make a credit card
payment online, or alternatively you can download the invoice to make a
payment via BPAY or EFT. The invoice will display your options for payment
which are BPay, EFT or credit card payment over the phone. Payment of the fee
must be finalised within 7 calendar days from the date of the invoice. To
ensure your payment is finalised (i.e received and processed by the
Department) within 7 calendar days, you should make payment as soon as you are
prompted to make an online payment or when the invoice is available.

Further details on the payment process can be found from the How to submit an
online application guides from [Guides and Forms](pharmaceutical-benefits-
scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms).

**What happens if my payment is not finalised within 7 calendar days from the
date of the invoice?**

If the Department has not received the payment within 7 calendar days from the
date of the invoice the application will be cancelled.

**If there are other applications ahead of mine for the same location, and
mine is likely to be rejected as a result, why should I pay the full
application fee?**

All applications to establish a new or relocate an existing pharmacy go
through the same checking and assessment processes by both the Department and
the ACPA, regardless of whether there are multiple applications for the same
location or where an application sits in the queue. As the fees are to recover
costs associated with these regulatory processes, payment of the full
application fee applies.

**If my application is deemed invalid because I haven’t provided the correct
information and I need to resubmit, will I have to pay another fee?**

No, if on preliminary review your application is deemed invalid by the
Department because you have not provided the correct information or documents,
you will be asked to resubmit the application. While you will not have to pay
another fee, lodgement will be recorded as the date and time the application
is resubmitted, which may push it down the queue.

**If my application is deferred by the ACPA and further information requested,
do I have to pay another fee?**

No, if the ACPA requests further information for consideration at a later
meeting or out of session, you will not be required to pay another fee.

**What happens if I withdraw my application after I’ve paid? Do I get a
refund?**

You can withdraw your application at any time; however, no refunds will be
issued once an invoice for the application fee has been paid.

**Is there a fee for Ministerial Discretion?**

No, fees do not apply when requesting Ministerial Discretion, which is
considered an appeal process, not a regulatory activity. Therefore, requests
for Ministerial Discretion are not subject to cost recovery fees.

**Is there a fee for medical practitioners or hospital authorities seeking
approval?**

Applications from medical practitioners or hospital authorities seeking
approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits do not incur a fee.

### Ministerial Discretion

**What is the purpose of the Minister’s discretionary power?**

To allow the Minister to approve a pharmacist to supply pharmaceutical
benefits if the application of the Pharmacy Location Rules has resulted in a
community being left without reasonable access to the supply of pharmaceutical
benefits.

**Can't the Minister just amend the Pharmacy Location Rules if they’re not
working?**

The Minister will consider amending the Pharmacy Location Rules if clear
problems are identified. However, amending the Pharmacy Location Rules in
response to individual cases would be neither timely nor efficient.

**If I’ve identified an area of need, can I go directly to the Minister for
approval?**

No. A request can only be made to the Minister if:

  * an application for approval under section 90 of the Act has been made; and
  * the Secretary (or the Secretary's delegate) has decided not to approve the application on the basis that it does not meet the requirements of the Pharmacy Location Rules.

This means you will still need to make an application under the Pharmacy
Location Rules for consideration by the ACPA. For more information about the
application process, please see the [Pharmacy Location Rules – Applicant's
Handbook](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms).

**The Secretary has rejected my application. Do I need to exhaust all appeals
before I can go to the Minister?**

No. You don’t need to have appealed the Secretary’s decision in order to
request that the Minister exercise their discretionary power. However, if you
have initiated any appeal proceedings in either the Administrative Appeals
Tribunal (AAT) or a federal court, they must be finalised or discontinued
before you can make a request to the Minister.

If you make a request to the Minister, and you then initiate any appeal
proceedings before the Minister has made a decision, your request will be
treated as if it had been withdrawn.

If the Minister does not agree to your request, and you had not previously
appealed the Secretary’s decision, you can still do so within 28 days of being
notified of the Minister’s decision.

You should seek independent legal advice regarding your entitlement to review
by the AAT or a federal court.

It is important to note that the Minister is not obligated to consider a
request and cannot be compelled to do so.

**If I request the Minister’s intervention, how long will the process take?**

Up to six months. The Minister has three months from the date you lodge your
request with the Department in which to decide whether or not to consider your
request. You will be notified of this decision in writing.

If the Minister decides to consider your request, the Minister has a further
three months in which to decide whether or not to exercise the discretionary
power. You will be notified of this decision in writing.

**If I request the Minister’s intervention, are there any requirements I will
have to meet?**

Yes. Firstly, the Minister can only consider valid requests. A valid request
is one that is made within the required timeframe, in the required form, and
is in respect of a certain type of decision (that is, a decision by the
Secretary to reject an application based on the Pharmacy Location Rules) and
which is not the subject of an appeal in the AAT or a federal court. For more
information about what makes a request valid, please refer to paragraph 3.1 of
the [Ministerial Discretion Guidelines](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-
approved-supplier-guides-and-forms).

To exercise the discretionary power, the Minister must be satisfied of two
things:

  * as a result of the Secretary’s decision, a community will not have reasonable access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by an approved pharmacist; and
  * approving the pharmacist is in the public interest.

For each request, it will be up to the Minister to determine the community
that is relevant to that request, and what constitutes ‘reasonable access’ to
the supply of pharmaceutical benefits.

The pharmacist making the request must also be permitted under the relevant
State or Territory law to carry on business as a pharmacist at the proposed
premises.

**I’m requesting the Minister’s intervention. Do I have to include anything
with my request form?**

Yes. The Minister has determined the form in which requests must be made,
which consists of a completed [Request Form](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-
approved-supplier-guides-and-forms) and several other pieces of information.
These are described in more detail at paragraph 2.5 of the [Ministerial
Discretion Guidelines](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-
guides-and-forms).

Please provide only necessary, relevant information and limit your request to
10 pages.

**Will other pharmacists be advised about my request?**

Very likely, but your identity will remain confidential. Once the Department
receives a valid request, it may write to pharmacists who are located in the
area of the proposed pharmacy to advise that a request has been made and
invite comment. Any comments received will be provided to the Minister with
the request.

Pharmacists who are invited to, and provide comment on a request, will also be
advised of the Minister’s decision.

**Are there any matters that the Minister will not take into account when
considering a request?**

The commercial interests of the pharmacist making the request, or of any other
party, are not generally considered to be relevant.

**What happens if the Minister decides to exercise the discretionary power?**

When the Minister exercises their discretionary power, the Minister will
substitute the Secretary’s decision not to approve the pharmacist with a
decision to approve the pharmacist. The Minister may attach conditions to such
an approval.

As soon as practicable after the Minister’s decision, the Department will
allocate an approval number to that pharmacist. If the pharmacist has not
already provided evidence that they are permitted under the relevant State or
Territory law to carry on business as a pharmacist at the proposed premises,
they must provide such evidence before the approval is activated to allow
claims for supplies of pharmaceutical benefits to be made.

An approval granted by the Minister using this discretionary power is treated,
for all intents and purposes, as if it were an approval granted under section
90 of the Act. That is, the approved pharmacist has the same rights and
obligations as any other approved pharmacist.

If a pharmacist approved by the Minister subsequently wishes to relocate the
pharmacy, they will be required to submit an application for consideration
against the requirements of the Pharmacy Location Rules. In addition, if the
Minister has attached conditions to the approval regarding future relocations,
the pharmacist must comply with those conditions.

**Can an applicant or a third party appeal a decision of the Minister to
approve or not approve a request?**

Applicants or third parties who believe they are aggrieved by the Minister’s
decision may be entitled to seek a review by a federal court. It is
recommended that independent legal advice be obtained before proceeding.
