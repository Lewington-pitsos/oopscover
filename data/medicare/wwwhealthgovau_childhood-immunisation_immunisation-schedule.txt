The [National Immunisation Program](/our-work/national-immunisation-program
"National Immunisation Program") schedule outlines the routine childhood
immunisations recommended for all children in Australia. Children can receive
these vaccines free as long as they are on a [Medicare Card or are eligible
for one](/childhood-immunisation/routine-childhood-immunisation#who-can-get-
free-vaccines "Routine childhood immunisation").

There are extra vaccines recommended for some children with certain medical
conditions. Talk to your health professional to see if your child needs extra
vaccines.

See the full [National Immunisation Program
Schedule](/topics/immunisation/when-to-get-vaccinated/national-immunisation-
program-schedule "National Immunisation Program Schedule") for more
information.
