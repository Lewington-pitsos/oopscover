## Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Register

We are required by the _Privacy (Australian Government Agencies – Governance)
APP[Code](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-for-government-agencies/)
2017_ (Cth) (the Code) to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for
projects with a high privacy risk.

A project may be a high privacy risk if we consider that the project involves
any new or changed ways of handling personal information that are likely to
have a significant impact on the privacy of individuals.

We are required by the Code to maintain a register of the PIAs it conducts. We
have listed all PIAs conducted by us since we commenced operations on 1 July
2016.

## Electronic Prescribing Conformance Register

A register of conforming software products has been created to ensure that
software developers are creating software that is conformant to government
legislation, and for healthcare providers and vendors to understand which
software companies are conformant. [Find out
more](https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/healthcare-providers/initiatives-and-
programs/my-health-record/conformant-clinical-software-products) on My Health
Record.

### A register of conforming software products

This register will be used for the following stakeholders:

  * **Open prescription delivery services** will be able to integrate into systems, this allows for vendors to connect into the operations of the electronic prescribing environment.
  * **Health care providers** will be able to make decisions on which electronic prescribing software they use, based on whether the software is conformant to legislation.
  * **Regulators** will also be able to see and understand which software is conformant and follows government legislation.

### Conformant Software Register
