## What diagnostic imaging is

Diagnostic imaging enables healthcare workers to see inside your body. They
use the images created to diagnose, treat and monitor a large range of health
conditions.

There are several types of diagnostic imaging including:

  * radiation

    * [X-rays](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/x-rays) (including mammography)

    * [CT (computed tomography) scans](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/ct-scan)

    * [PET (positron emission tomography) scans](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/pet-scan) and other nuclear medicine imaging 

  * magnetic fields and radio waves – [MRIs](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri) (magnetic resonance imaging) 

  * sound waves – [ultrasounds](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/ultrasound). 

## Laws and regulation

The [Health Insurance Act
1973](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2022C00174) and its subordinate
legislation, including the [Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services
Table) Regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2022C00524),
regulate diagnostic imaging services under Medicare.

Only [accredited practices](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/medicare-
eligibility-to-provide-diagnostic-imaging-and-radiation-oncology-services) can
perform Medicare-funded diagnostic imaging services.

The [Diagnostic Imaging Accreditation
Scheme](https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/standards/diagnostic-
imaging/diagnostic-imaging-accreditation-scheme) ensures that diagnostic
imaging practices meet safety and quality standards.

The [Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety
Agency](https://www.arpansa.gov.au/) (ARPANSA) helps to avoid excess radiation
doses for patients undergoing diagnostic imaging.
