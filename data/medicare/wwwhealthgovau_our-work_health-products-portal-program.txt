## **About the** **program**

We launched the Health Products Portal (HPP) in October 2019, focusing on the
pharmaceutical industry and management of items on the PBS. We are expanding
the HPP to digitise and simplify the processes to apply, track, pay and manage
regulated and reimbursed health-related products and services listed on the:

  * [Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme](https://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) (PBS) through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC)
  * [Medicare Benefits Schedule](http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/Home) (MBS) through the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC)
  * [Prostheses List](/topics/private-health-insurance/the-prostheses-list "The Prostheses List") (PL) through the Prostheses List Advisory Committee (PLAC)
  * [National Immunisation Program](/topics/immunisation/when-to-get-vaccinated/national-immunisation-program-schedule "National Immunisation Program Schedule") (NIP) through the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).

The HPP aligns to the Australian Government’s Digital Service Standard. We are
consulting with industry groups and end users (through user research and beta
testing activities) as part of a user-centred approach.
