# Regulation Impact Statements

 __Page last updated: 16 February 2016

Government policy makers are required to assess the benefit of their proposed
decisions against the effects they may have on business, community
organisations and individuals. A key focus of the regulatory reform agenda is
the identification of the regulatory impact of major decisions. The tool used
to document the assessment of viable policy options, including the option of
regulating, is a Regulation Impact Statement (RIS). In most cases, a RIS will
be a public document, addressing:

  * What the problem is that needs to be solved? 
  * Why government action is needed? 
  * What policy options are being considered? 
  * What is the likely net benefit of each option? 
  * Who needs to be consulted about the options and how will this be achieved? 
  * What is the best option from those that have been considered? 
  * How will the chosen option be implemented and evaluated?

  
The Office of Best Practice Regulation (OBPR) administers the government’s
regulatory impact analysis requirements. The OBPR is a branch within the
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's (PM&C) Regulatory Reform
Division.  
  
To encourage policy makers to think about regulatory impacts early in the
policy process, PM&C has produced a handbook to guide regulation, [The
Australian Government Guide to Regulation
](http://cuttingredtape.gov.au/handbook/australian-government-guide-
regulation)
