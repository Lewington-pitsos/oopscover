## About HeaDS UPP

The Health Demand and Supply Utilisation Patterns Planning (HeaDS UPP) Tool is
a new integrated source of health workforce and services data that informs
workforce planning and analysis. It is currently being rolled out to select
government and non-government organisations involved in workforce planning.

### The HeaDS UPP Tool

HeaDS UPP brings health data together to visually highlight how the community
uses and accesses health services and the health workforce. It provides a
single access point to workforce data from a number of data sets such the
Medicare Benefits Schedule, Australian General Practitioner Training, Royal
Flying Doctor Service Program, National Health Workforce data set, National
Health Service Directory, and others.

You can see this data mapped according to geographical regions, such as the
newly created General Practitioner (GP) Catchment areas, and use this data to
better understand workforce issues at a local level.

Additional information is available in the [HeaDS UPP Tool
Factsheet](../resources/primary/heads-upp-factsheet-jan-2021.pdf).
