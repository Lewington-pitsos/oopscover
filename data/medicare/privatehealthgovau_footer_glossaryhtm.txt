(Extras) cover.

Accident Cover

    Some hospital policies do offer accident cover, for treatment of injuries sustained in an accident. Accident cover differs between insurers so check with your insurer as to what is covered.Â It may include transportation in an ambulance for emergencies and the option to attend an emergency department at a private hospital when you have an accident. 
Accidents

    An accident for private health insurance purposes is commonly defined as an injury that occurred unintentionally or unexpectedly that requires treatment by a registered medical practitioner at a hospital. Other conditions may apply. Check with your insurer for details.
Accommodation

    Accommodation covers meals and a bed in hospital, and includes all in-hospital-provided services including nursing care. It does not include treatment by doctors or other health professionals.
Admission

    To receive treatment as a private patient in a hospital you need to be admitted by a doctor. Treatment in the emergency room is not considered admission.
Age-based discount

    Australians aged 18-29 years of age can be offered discounts of up to 10 per cent of their private hospital insurance premiums - check with your insurer for details.
Agreement hospital

    Private hospital or day surgery contracted with an insurer to provide services at low or no out-of-pocket costs.
Ambulance cover

    Medicare does not cover the cost of emergency transport or other ambulance services. Depending on your state of residence, you can purchase ambulance cover from an insurer or subscribe to a state ambulance service, or you may be covered by state government arrangements. For more information see: [What is covered - Ambulance](/health_insurance/what_is_covered/ambulance.htm "Ambulance")
Ancillary policy

    See General treatment policy.
Annual limits

    The maximum benefit payable for a particular service within a 12 month period. Annual limits can be calculated based on a calendar year, or financial year, or for every 12-month period from the anniversary date of taking out a private health insurance policy.
Appliance

    Small item used to compensate for reduced functionality, such as a hearing aid or colostomy pouch.
APRA

    The [Australian Prudential Regulation Authority](http://www.apra.gov.au "Links - Other Australian Prudential Regulation Authority \(APRA\)") is an independent body that regulates the financial aspects of the private health insurance industry.
Artificial aids

    See: Health aids
Australian Government Rebate

    Most Australians with private health insurance currently receive a Rebate from the Australian Government to help cover the cost of their premiums. The Private Health Insurance Rebate is income tested. For more information see [Private Health Insurance Rebate](/health_insurance/surcharges_incentives/insurance_rebate.htm "Australian Government Private Health Insurance Rebate").
'Available From' date

    The 'Available From' date on a PHIS is the date that the policy is available for purchase. This date only appears when the policy is only available for purchase date is in the future. Once that date has passed the 'Available From' information disappears from the PHIS.
Basic private hospital policy

    A basic level of private hospital policy which excludes or restricts one or more major medical services, such as cardiac and cardiac-related services. No benefits are paid for excluded services and only limited benefits are paid for restricted items. For more information on Basic hospital cover, see [How health insurance works](/health_insurance/index.htm "How health insurance works").
Benefit limitation period

    Before 1 July 2018 some private health insurers imposed benefit limitation periods (BLPs) of up to 24 months for some categories of hospital treatment. During a BLP, you were only entitled to restricted benefits for a particular condition or treatment. BLPs are no longer in use in private health insurance.
Benefit limits

    The benefit limit is the most amount of money you can claim for a service, usually in a 12 month period.
Benefit

    The amount you can claim from the insurer for a specific service. This may be listed on the PHIS as a dollar amount (maximum benefit) or as a percentage amount (percentage benefit). For example: Maximum benefit - for each visit to a physiotherapist you can claim up to $50; Percentage benefit - for each visit to a physiotherapist you can claim up to 75% of the total cost. Some policies may use a combination of both dollar and percentage amounts (for example: for each visit to a physiotherapist you can claim 75% of the cost up to a maximum of $50) - this kind of benefit is not currently displayed on the PHIS so itâs important to check with your insurer about what your policy covers.
Benefits for travel & accommodation (outside of hospital)

    If you require travel to a hospital for treatment and/or accommodation once you get there, you may be able to claim some of the costs back if your policy covers this. Check with your insurer for details.
Brand

    Additional trading name for an insurer, used in one or more states.
Bronze cover (hospital)

    Bronze policies will provide cover in hospital for some treatments covered by Medicare.
Call-out fees

    A fixed fee charged every time an ambulance is called. Per-kilometre charges also apply to most ambulance trips.
Classification

    The general level of cover on a given policy, to allow easy comparisons.Â Hospital policies are classified as Gold, Silver, Bronze or Basic.Â For more information, see [Private Health Insurance Basics](/health_insurance/howitworks/index.htm "Private Health Insurance Basics").
Closed policy

    A policy which is no longer available for sale, but which continues to cover existing members.
Co-payment

    For a hospital policy a co-payment is a set amount that you agree to pay for each day you are in hospital, in exchange for lower premiums. For example, you may agree to pay the first $50 per day in hospital. Most co-payments have a limit on the number of days they apply per stay. It can also be called an overnight excess, daily excess or patient moiety.

For a general treatment policy you may be required to pay a co-payment for
some services before a benefit will be paid. For example, it is common for
pharmacy items to require a co-payment of the equivalent to the amount listed
for the items on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Always check with
your insurer about what co-payments you may need to pay.

Combined limit

    In a general treatment policy some of the services that are covered may have a combined limit - this means that for all of the services in the combination, you can only claim a certain amount across all of them.
Combined policy

    Most insurers offer combined policies that provide a packaged cover for both hospital and general treatment services.
Community rating

    Private health insurance is 'community-rated'. This means that everyone is entitled to buy the same policy, at the same price, and is guaranteed the right to renew their policy. A health insurer cannot refuse to insure you, or refuse to sell you any policy you want to buy. There are some exceptions to this - for example, you will pay a higher premium if you have a Lifetime Health Cover loading.
Corporate policy

    A policy developed by a health insurer for a specific company, generally available to employees of that company only.
Covered

    If a PHIS has marked a service as 'covered' this means that the policy provides some level of coverage for that service. Contact your insurer for details.
Daily excess

    See Co-payment.
Day surgery

    A private hospital or facility where patients are admitted, treated and discharged on the same day. Also called day facility or day hospital.
Default benefit

    The âdefaultâ or minimum benefit is the lowest amount that a health insurer is permitted to pay for a hospital admission that is included on policy. See: Minimum Benefit
Department of Health and Aged Care

    The government department which is responsible for policies relating to private health insurance.
Dependant

    A dependent child is an unmarried person under the age of 18 years. An insurer may choose to continue considering a person between the ages of 18 and 31 years as a dependent child, but will usually require certain conditions to be met - for example, the person may have to be a full-time student. Insurers can also choose to cover dependents with a disability without any age limit. These conditions vary between insurers, so check with your insurer to see which rules they apply.
Diagnostic tests

    The most common diagnostic tests include x-rays, scans and blood tests.
Drugs, dressings and other consumables

    Drugs, dressings and other consumables are additional services to support hospital treatment. These included medications, bandages, crutches and surgically implanted prostheses (such as hip replacements, artificial lenses and heart valves).
Elective surgery

    Surgical treatment of a condition that your doctor considers does not require immediate (emergency) attention.
Eligibility Checking System

    An online system that hospitals can use to electronically confirm the membership details and benefits for a patient who is to be admitted to hospital for treatment. This system is available on-line 24 hours a day.
Emergency ambulance

    Cover for ambulance transport in an emergency situation (situation requiring immediate medical treatment)
Emergency treatment

    Emergency treatment occurs when the patient is treated by the medical practitioner within 30 minutes of presentation and the patient is in danger of suffering loss of life, limb, bodily function or mental stability, is in severe pain or is bleeding. For insurance purposes, your health insurer may have a different definition of 'emergency' - check with your health insurer for details.
Examples of maximum benefits

    In the PHIS for a general treatment policy, each service that is covered includes an example of the maximum benefit you can claim for common treatments.
Excess

    

Also called a front-end deductible, an excess is an amount that you agree to
pay towards the cost of hospital treatment, in exchange for lower premium
costs.

You may be required to pay an excess every time you go to hospital, or only
the first time. Depending on the type of hospitalisation (e.g day surgery or
overnight stays) you may only have to pay a part excess (for example an excess
of $500 may apply to overnight hospitalisation but only $100 applies to day
surgery.)

What excess (if any) you will need to pay depends on the policy you take out.
Always check with your insurer.

Exclusions

    Conditions or services which your health insurance policy does not include, meaning that your insurer will not pay benefits towards hospital or medical costs for these items. If you choose to proceed as a private patient for an excluded service, you will have very large out of pocket expenses. If the services are eligible under Medicare, you can still receive treatment as a public patient â however, public hospital waiting lists will apply and you should discuss this option with your doctor. For more information, see:Â [Policy Exclusions and Restrictions](https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/publications-and-news-pages/publication-pages/brochures-and-factsheets/factsheets/private-health-insurance/policy-exclusions-and-restrictions "Factsheet - Policy Exclusions and Restrictions")
Extras

    See General treatment policy.
Front-end deductible

    See Excess.
Fund

    Private health insurance organisation - also known as an Insurer.
Gap cover arrangements

    Gap cover arrangements minimise any gaps between the Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) fee and what doctors actually charge. Some gap cover arrangements provide partial cover for the gap between the MBS fee and actual doctor's fee. Other gap cover arrangements provide full cover. Doctors can decide to use the gap cover arrangements on a case-by-case basis, so full cover cannot usually be guaranteed by the insurer.
Gap

    A 'gap' is the amount you pay out of your own pocket for treatment in hospital, either for medical or hospital charges over and above what you get back from Medicare or your private health insurer. Some health insurers have gap cover arrangements to insure against some or all of these additional payments.
General dental

    Minor dental services, such as annual checkups, cleaning and fluoride treatment. Whether specific items are classified as general or major dental depends on each insurerâs rules, so check with your insurer for details.
General treatment policy

    Health insurance to cover non-hospital medical services that are not covered by Medicare, such as dental, optical, physiotherapy, other therapies and ambulance. Also known as 'extras' or 'ancillary' insurance.
Gold hospital cover

Hospital insurance

    Health insurance to cover your costs as a private patient in hospital, including hospital accommodation, medical treatment and ambulance (in some states).
Hospital treatment for which Medicare pays no benefit

    Medicare does not recognise or pay benefits towards some forms of hospital treatment, such as treatment that is not medically necessary (for example, cosmetic surgery) or experimental treatments. Health insurers are not required to pay benefits towards hospital treatments where Medicare does not pay a benefit.
In-patient

    A patient who has been formally admitted to a hospital or day facility.

Jurisdiction

    See State.
Labour ward fees

    Labour ward fees include costs for delivery of babies in a birthing suite.
Lifetime Health Cover (LHC)

    

Lifetime Health Cover is a government initiative introduced from 1 July 2000.
It was designed to encourage people to take out hospital insurance earlier in
life, and to maintain their cover. People who take out (and keep) hospital
insurance before their 'base day' pay lower premiums throughout their lifetime
than people who join later. Generally, your base day is the later of 1 July
2000 or the 1 July following your 31st birthday.Â

If you join after your base day, you pay 2% more for each year you are aged
over 30 for your private hospital insurance premiums than someone who joined
before their base day. If you join at 35, you pay 10% more and if you join at
50, you'll pay 40% more. LHC only applies to hospital policies - there are no
age penalties or incentives for general treatment policies. Some exceptions
apply for Australians who have been living overseas and new migrants. For more
on LHC, please see: [Lifetime Health
Cover](/health_insurance/surcharges_incentives/lifetime_health_cover.htm
"Lifetime Health Cover").

Lifetime limit

    The maximum benefit payable for a particular service for the lifetime of the member. If you use up your lifetime limit and transfer to a new insurer, your new insurer may deduct the benefits you have already claimed from your new policyâs lifetime limit â check with your insurer for details.
Loyalty incentive schemes

    

Some insurers have loyalty incentive schemes that reward long-term members by
increasing either the annual limit or the benefit amount you can claim for
specific services. Please contact your insurer for further information about
loyalty incentive schemes.

If you change insurers, loyalty limits and benefits are generally not
transferrable.

MBS payable item

    Services listed under the Medicare Benefits Schedule, which includes medical services necessary to maintain your health. Some services are not covered by the MBS, such as elective cosmetic surgery.
Medical expenses

    Medical expenses are charges for medical procedures performed during a hospital stay. This includes items such as surgeons' fees, obstetricians' fees, radiology, pathology and anaesthetists. Medicare pays 75% of the MBS fee for these services. Doctors may charge more than the MBS fee.
Medical gap

    See gap.
Medical service

    A service provided by a doctor, specialist, radiologist, pathologist, anaesthetist or other medical provider.
Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)

    The schedule of fees set by the government for standard medical services, based on a fair price and how much Australia can afford to pay for the total health system. Whether you have private health insurance or are a private patient paying for all your own costs, the government provides a rebate on nearly all medical fees. This rebate is currently 75% of the MBS fee for in-hospital medical fees and 85% of the MBS fee for specialist medical fees incurred out of hospital. You can purchase hospital insurance to cover the remaining 25% of the MBS fee and gap cover to assist in minimising any potential additional fees incurred in-hospital if the doctor charges more than the MBS fee.
Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS)

    The Medicare Levy Surcharge is levied on Australian taxpayers who earn above a certain income and do not have private hospital insurance. The Surcharge aims to encourage individuals to take out private hospital cover, and where possible, to use the private system to reduce the demand on the public system. The Surcharge is calculated at the rate of 1% to 1.5% of taxable income. It is in addition to the Medicare Levy of 2%, which is paid by most Australian taxpayers. The Medicare Levy Surcharge is imposed on individuals earning over the threshold who do not have an appropriate level of hospital insurance. For the current income thresholds, see [Medicare Levy Surcharge](/health_insurance/surcharges_incentives/medicare_levy.htm "Medicare Levy Surcharge").
Medicare Levy Surcharge exemption

    Most hospital policies are sufficient to exempt you from being liable to pay the Medicare Levy Surcharge. If you plan to use your insurance for exemption from the Surcharge, check with your insurer to ensure it meets the Surcharge requirements. General treatment policies, overseas visitors and overseas students health cover policies do not exempt you from the Surcharge.
Medicare

    Medicare is the publicly funded universal health care system in Australia. Operated by Services Australia, Medicare is the primary funder of health care in Australia, funding primary health care for Australian citizens and permanent residents including Norfolk Island.
Minimum benefit

    

The minimum benefit (sometimes called the "default" benefit) is the lowest
amount that a health insurer is permitted to pay for a hospital admission that
is included on policy. It is equivalent to the amount a public hospital would
charge a private patient for a shared room, usually as an all inclusive daily
rate of approximately $250-$300 depending on where you are in Australia.

If you are entitled to only the minimum benefit and are attending a private
hospital, the extra charges you will need to pay yourself include the amount
above what the hospital charges for accommodation as well as theatre or labour
ward plus any fees for medical services and other items such as
pharmaceuticals that arenât covered by your insurer (see [What is
covered?](/health_insurance/what_is_covered/index.htm "What is covered?") for
further details).

The cost of theatre or labour ward in a private facility depends on the
complexity of the procedure being performed and can range from a couple of
hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. If you are proceeding with
private hospital treatment and are only entitled to a minimum benefit, it is
strongly recommended that you obtain a quote from the hospital and medical
practitioners before admission.

Monthly premium

    The amount you pay for your health insurance each month. Note that the price shown on the Private Health Information Statement is not a quote and should only be used to compare the cost of different health insurer policies. The PHISs show the full monthly premium and the monthly premium with the Standard Rebate deducted. It does not include any Lifetime Health Cover loading or factor in any discounts that may be available or the different level of Rebate that may apply - most people are eligible for the Standard Rebate, but this may vary depending on your income and age group. Contact your insurer for a specific quote.
Naturopathy

    Naturopathy uses a range of alternative approaches to medical treatments. Naturopathy can include nutrition, dietetics, herbal medicine, homoeopathy and massage but is not covered by private health insurance.
Non-emergency ambulance

    Non-emergency ambulance includes transport where immediate medical treatment is not deemed necessary, or for transportation from a hospital to your home or another hospital.
Norfolk Island residents

    From 1 July 2016, residents of Norfolk Island are eligible for Medicare benefits and can therefore also purchase Australian private health insurance policies. Residents of Norfolk Island can purchase the same policies as residents of NSW.
Not covered

    Conditions or services which your health insurance policy does not include, meaning that your insurer will not pay benefits towards hospital or medical costs for these items. If you choose to proceed as a private patient for an excluded service, you will have very large out of pocket expenses. If the services are eligible under Medicare, you can still receive treatment as a public patient â however, public hospital waiting lists will apply and you should discuss this option with your doctor.
Occupational therapy

    An occupational therapist can help people improve their everyday motor skills after injury or illness.
Other features

    Generally used by Insurers to display any features or information about the policy that does not fit into the Private Health Information Statement format. This may include disease management programs and other programs that support healthy lifestyles, discounts, bonus schemes, waivers, reductions, or additional services offered.
Other services

    

Where a Private Health Information Statement lists âOther servicesâ, you
should check with your insurer for details about items which are not listed on
the PHIS.

Out-of-pocket costs

    Out-of-pockets costs are the costs you pay out of your own pocket for treatment in hospital, either for medical or hospital charges over and above what you get back from Medicare or your private health insurer. Some health insurers have gap cover arrangements to insure against some or all of these additional payments.
Overnight excess

    See Co-payment.
Patient moiety

    See Co-payment.
PBS

    The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) provides a government subsidy to reduce the price of some prescription medicines.

Portability

    The ability for people to transfer from one insurer to another, without re-serving waiting periods. Portability usually only applies if you transfer within a set period of leaving the previous insurer. Check with your new insurer for details.
Pre-existing condition

    A pre-existing condition is an ailment, illness or condition, the signs or symptoms of which, in the opinion of a medical practitioner appointed by the health insurer, existed at any time during the six months prior to taking out hospital cover or upgrading to a higher level of cover. Health insurers are able to impose a maximum 12 month waiting period for hospital treatment for ailments, illnesses or conditions that are considered to be pre-existing. For psychiatric care, rehabilitation and palliative care, the maximum waiting period is two months, even if the condition is pre-existing. If you are going to hospital during your waiting period, it is important to check with your health insurer prior to the admission as to whether you will be covered or if the condition will be deemed pre-existing.
Preferred provider

    

Some health insurers have arrangements with general treatment providers (known
as preferred providers) to provide services to their members at a higher
benefit rate than that of a non-preferred provider.

Each insurer has their own preferred provider network - please contact your
insurer for further information about their preferred providers.

Private Health Insurance Rebate

    Most Australians with private health insurance currently receive a Rebate from the Australian Government to help cover the cost of their premiums. The Private Health Insurance Rebate is income tested. For more information see [](/health_insurance/surcharges_incentives/insurance_rebate.htm "Australian Government Private Health Insurance Rebate")[Private Health Insurance Rebate](/health_insurance/surcharges_incentives/insurance_rebate.htm "Australian Government Private Health Insurance Rebate").
Private hospital

    A hospital run as a commercial and/or charitable operation.
Private patient in a private hospital

    

Depending on the circumstances, being a private patient in a private hospital
or a private day hospital facility allows you to choose the doctor(s) who
treats you at a time that suits you. This is provided your doctor(s) has an
arrangement with that hospital to treat private patients and the hospital you
have chosen has beds and has available the services you will need.

As a private patient in a private hospital, you may be charged for a range of
services which could include:

  * care in intensive/critical care units,
  * doctor(s) services (including diagnostic tests),
  * operating theatre fees,
  * allied health services (eg. physiotherapy),
  * dressings, medications/drugs, other consumables,
  * surgically implanted prostheses (eg. artificial hips),
  * personal expenses such as TV hire and telephone calls.

The hospital and the treating doctor(s) should, where possible, advise you
about the services for which you will be billed. Check with your insurer to
find out which costs are covered by your policy.

Private room

    Depending on your level of cover you can request a private room - that is, one that is not shared with another patient.
Product code

    The code used by an insurer to identify their own specific policies.
Prostheses (surgically implanted)

    Surgically implanted prostheses include such things as hip replacements, artificial lenses and heart valves.
Provider

    A person or business qualified to supply medical services, such as a clinic, therapist, dentist, etc.
Psychiatric services

    The treatment of mental illness, including drug and alcohol rehabilitation, eating disorders, and post-natal depression. In-hospital psychiatric treatment is included or restricted on all Hospital policies. The maximum waiting period on this item is 2 months, even if the condition is pre-existing. In some cases, you may be able to upgrade and obtain an exemption from this waiting period - see [Waiting periods](/health_insurance/howitworks/waiting_periods.htm "Waiting periods").
Public hospital

    A hospital provided by the Government. 'Recognised' public hospitals have access to the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and private health insurance arrangements.
Public patient

    You are a public patient if you choose to be treated in a public hospital under Medicare, by a doctor appointed by the hospital.
Rate

    See Premium.
Rebate

    See Private Health Insurance Rebate.
Restricted access insurer

    See Restricted membership insurer.
Restricted benefits

    See Restrictions.
Restricted fund

    See Restricted membership insurer.
Restricted membership insurer

    A health insurer providing insurance to a specific industry or group, usually on a not-for-profit basis. You must be a member of the industry or group to join the insurer. In some cases, family members are also eligible.
Restrictions

    Condition or services which an insurance policy covers to a limited extent and will pay reduced benefits on hospital admissions. It is not sufficient to cover the cost of a private room in a public hospital or any room in a private hospital. If you are admitted to a private hospital for treatment that is restricted by your policy, large out of pocket expenses will apply. You will have to pay the full theatre fees and other costs as well as the difference for accommodation fees; in some cases theatre fees can exceed the cost of accommodation. If the services are eligible under Medicare, you can still receive treatment as a public patient â however, public hospital waiting lists will apply and you should discuss this option with your doctor. For more information, see:Â [Factsheet - Policy Exclusions and Restrictions](https://www.ombudsman.gov.au/publications-and-news-pages/publication-pages/brochures-and-factsheets/factsheets/private-health-insurance/policy-exclusions-and-restrictions "Factsheet - Policy Exclusions and Restrictions")
Same-day patient

    You are a same-day patient if you are admitted, treated and discharged on the same day. Also called day surgery.
Shared room

    A shared room is one that you share with other patients in the hospital - that is, not a private room.
Silver cover (hospital)

    Silver policies will provide cover in hospital for most treatments covered by Medicare.
Special features text

    In a general treatment policy, if particular services have extra information they will display with an asterisk and extra text is added in the Special Features text.
State of the Health Funds Report

    The annual report on insurer performance and service delivery, prepared by PHIO and available online at the Ombudsman website.
State

    Australian State or Territory. Also called Jurisdiction.
Status

    Availability of specific policy: Available or Closed.
Sub-limits

    The maximum benefit payable for a particular service within a 12 month period, which is deducted from a larger limit. For example, a policy may have a combined $500 limit for acupuncture, naturopathy and remedial massage, with a sub-limit of $300 for each service â meaning the most you could claim in a single year for one of those services is $300, while the remaining $200 could be claimed against one or both of the other two.
Suspension

    A suspension of health cover means that, with the agreement of your health insurer, you may stop paying your premiums for an agreed period of time. You will not be able to claim any benefits during your suspension. It is important to check whether you will need to re-serve any waiting periods after a period of suspension as rules vary between health insurers. In addition, if you are over the income threshold you will be required to pay the [Medicare Levy Surcharge](/health_insurance/surcharges_incentives/medicare_levy.htm "Medicare Levy Surcharge") for the period that yourÂ hospital policy is suspended. Health insurers may grant suspensions at their own discretion for circumstances such as working or studying overseas, financial hardship or temporary unemployment. Your [Lifetime Health Cover](/health_insurance/surcharges_incentives/lifetime_health_cover.htm "Lifetime Health Cover") status is not altered during a period in which your health insurer suspends your health insurance.
Theatre fees

    Theatre fees are costs for procedures performed in an operating room, including those performed in day surgery facilities.
Treatment exclusions

    See Exclusions.
Waiting period

    How long you will need to be a member before you are eligible for benefits. The Government has set maximum waiting periods for benefits for hospital services, but insurers can set their own waiting periods for general treatment benefits. The PHIS lists waiting periods in months for standard services.
