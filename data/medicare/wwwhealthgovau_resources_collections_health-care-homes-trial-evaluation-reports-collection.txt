Health Policy Analysis (HPA) has worked with experts from the University of
NSW and the University of Technology to evaluate the [Health Care
Homes](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-
care-homes) trial.

The evaluation aimed to:

  * identify the changes in structure and processes that occurred following the rollout of the trial
  * measure short-term outcomes
  * provide preliminary evidence concerning the medium to longer-term outcomes.

The key evaluation questions were:

  * How was the Health Care Homes model implemented and what were the barriers and enablers?
  * How does the Health Care Homes model change the way practices approach chronic disease management?
  * Do patients enrolled in Health Care Homes experience better quality care?
  * What are the financial effects of the Health Care Homes model on governments, providers and individuals?

Evaluation results and lessons learned will be used to inform future primary
care reform.
