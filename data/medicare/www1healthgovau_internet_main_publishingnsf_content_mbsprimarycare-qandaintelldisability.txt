Health Assessment for People with an Intellectual Disability

Questions and Answers

 __Page last updated: 11 April 2014

[Printable version of fact sheet (PDF 152
KB)](1319475AC73C0873CA257BF0001E8C09/$File/Revised%20Q&As%20Health%20assessment%20for%20people%20with%20and%20intellectual%20disability%20April%202014.pdf)  

## What is the purpose of the Health Assessment for People with an
Intellectual Disability?

The purpose of the health assessment is to support general practitioners (GPs)
to identify and address the specific clinical needs of patients who have an
intellectual disability, and to identify any medical intervention and
preventive health care required.  
  
Any of the time based MBS health assessment items (701, 703, 705 and 707) can
be used. However, a long or prolonged consultation may be required due to an
intellectual disability impeding a person’s capacity to: recognise and report
symptoms; provide a history; and seek and act on medical advice.  
  
A longer assessment may also be needed to establish whether or not a person
has previously undiagnosed health issues.  

## How often can a health assessment for a person with an intellectual
disability be undertaken?

A health assessment may be claimed once every twelve months by an eligible
patient .  

## How do you determine whether a person has an intellectual disability?

For the health assessment a person will be deemed to have an intellectual
disability if they have significantly sub-average general intellectual
functioning (two standard deviations below the average intelligence quotient
(IQ)) and would benefit from assistance with daily living activities. Where
GPs wish to confirm intellectual disability and a patient’s need for
assistance with activities of daily living, they may seek verification from a
paediatrician registered to practice in Australia or from a government-
provided or funded disability service that has assessed the patient’s
intellectual function.  

## Is it necessary to gain a patient’s consent prior to undertaking a health
assessment?

Yes. The patient or their representative must be given an explanation of the
health assessment process and its likely benefits, and must be asked by the
medical practitioner whether they consent to the health assessment being
performed. Consent must be noted on the patient record.  

## Who can undertake a Health Assessment for People with an Intellectual
Disability?

The health assessment should generally be undertaken by the patient’s ‘usual
doctor’, that is, the GP (or a GP in the same practice) who has provided the
majority of services to the patient in the past 12 months, and/or is likely to
provide the majority of services in the following 12 months.  
  
In circumstances where the patient’s usual medical practitioner or practice
does not undertake the health assessment, a copy of the health assessment
report should be forwarded to that medical practitioner or practice (subject
to the agreement of the patient or their representative).  
  
The medical practitioner is expected to take a primary role in the following
activities when providing a health assessment:

  * reviewing and analysing the information collected; 
  * making an overall assessment of the patient; 
  * undertaking and arranging investigations; 
  * making referrals and identifying appropriate follow-up; and 
  * providing advice to the patient.

## Can a practice nurse assist with the health assessment?

Yes. A practice nurse may assist medical practitioners in performing a health
assessment, in accordance with accepted medical practice and under the
supervision of the medical practitioner. This may include activities
associated with:

  * collecting information; and 
  * providing patients with information about recommended interventions at the direction of the medical practitioner.

## Is a proforma available for the health assessment for people with an
intellectual disability?

Yes. A proforma is available to assist medical practitioners to complete a
health assessment . This can be found on the Department of Health’s website at
the [Medicare and Primary Care Items Resource Kit
page](http://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/mha_resource_kit).  

## What should practitioners consider in addition to the clinical matters
listed in the MBS?

### Physical function

 _Activities of daily living_  
Assess the health impact of the patient’s general skill levels (including
independent living skills) and, if required, arrange a referral for a formal
review of the interaction between the patient, their impairment (if any) and
their environment.  

### Psychological function

 _Cognition_  
Investigate medical and psychiatric causes where problems with cognition and
skill decline are clinically suspected.  
Note that people with intellectual disability can develop dementia. Dementia
is particularly common in people with Down syndrome.  
  
_Mood_  
Consider depression where there is a history of weight change, changes in
sleep habit and escalation of behavioural problems.  
  
_Behaviour_  
Monitor the patient’s behavioural status and ensure that there are systems in
place to provide an objective measure of that status.  
If relevant, consult with disability support services and psychologists who
have responsibility for developing strategies to address challenging
behaviour.  
  
_Psychiatric symptoms_  
Consider psychiatric disorders where there are changes in behaviour.  
Be aware that psychiatric disorders occur more commonly in people with
intellectual disability and are often difficult to diagnose and distinguish
from a reaction to the person's physical and interpersonal environment.  

### Social function

 _Accommodation_  
Assess the suitability of the patient’s accommodation setting to provide the
best physical and psychological health outcomes. This should include
compatibility with other residents, the capacity of carers to support the
patient’s health and social needs, and identification of any health and safety
issues for that patient.  
If relevant, consult with disability professionals such as case managers who
have responsibility for assessing and facilitating appropriate accommodation.  

### Consultation with the patient’s carer and disability professionals

So far as possible, the practitioner should communicate directly with the
patient and take the extra time needed to do this. However, the patient may
have difficulty giving a history, explaining symptoms and following the
diagnosis and treatment recommendations.  
  
Where the patient has a carer, consider having them present for the assessment
or components of the assessment (subject to the patient’s agreement), and
discuss with them matters such as medication usage and compliance, continence
and physical, psychological and social function. Also, consider whether the
carer is able to meet the health-related needs of the patient.  
  
Where the provision of an assessment service involves consultation with a
patient it should be read as including consultation with the patient’s carer
where this is appropriate.  
  
It may also be important to consult with disability professionals, such as
case managers who have responsibility for assessing and facilitating
appropriate accommodation and disability support services and psychologists
who have responsibility for developing strategies to address challenging
behaviour. If the patient needs, but does not have such professionals, then
the practitioner should make appropriate referrals.  
  
A copy of the health assessment report (or relevant extracts) should be
offered to the carer and relevant disability professionals with the agreement
of the patient or his/her representative.  
  

### Medical

 _Health problem/s identified_  
Arrange follow up consultations to determine further management when an
assessment identifies issues requiring medical treatment such as high blood
pressure, or clinical examination reveals likelihood of other potential health
problem(s),  
  
_Chronic medical condition_  
Involve other health professionals in the patient’s care using the Chronic
Disease Management (CDM) item for GP Management Plans (MBS Item 721) and Team
Care Arrangements (MBS item 723) if an assessment identifies that a patient
has a chronic medical condition and complex care needs, and the patient needs
all of the eligibility criteria.  

### Patient register

Establish a register of patients seeking annual health assessments and remind
registered patients when their next health assessment is due.
