# Medical Benefits Reviews Task Group

The Australian Government announced in the 2009-10 Budget that it would fund
the development of a new evidence-based framework for managing the MBS into
the future (the MBS Quality Framework) and carry out parallel reviews of
Diagnostic Imaging and Pathology.

__Page last updated: 14 October 2015

The Medical Benefits Review Task Group (MBRTG) was formed specifically to
undertake the development work on the MBS Quality Framework and carry out the
Diagnostic Imaging and Pathology reviews. This work was completed in early
2011 and informed a range of Government announcements in the context of the
2011-12 Budget. They include the Comprehensive Management Framework for the
MBS, a five-year Pathology Funding Agreement between the Government and the
pathology sector from 1 July 2011 and a Diagnostic Imaging Reform Package that
includes $104.4 million to improve patient access to Medicare-eligible
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) services.  
  
The MBRTG will wind up on **30 June 2011**. Key documents and information that
were developed and circulated to inform discussion on the MBS Quality
Framework and the two reviews will be retained on this site until **30 June
2011**.  
  
During the life of the MBRTG, three teams worked on the development of the MBS
Quality Framework – the precursor to the Comprehensive Management Framework
for the MBS; the Pathology Services Review; and the Diagnostic Imaging Review.
Information has been grouped accordingly:
