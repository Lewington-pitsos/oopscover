This collection contains links to all the final reports, findings and
recommendations agreed by the [MBS Review Taskforce](/committees-and-
groups/mbs-review-taskforce "Medicare Benefits Schedule \(MBS\) Review
Taskforce") across all specialties as part of the [MBS Review](/our-work/mbs-
review "Medicare Benefits Schedule \(MBS\) Review ").

These documents contain almost 1,400 recommendations that the taskforce
provided to the Australian Government for its consideration and response.

Taskforce recommendations are expressed in the following formats:

  * **Taskforce final reports** are available for most specialties. These provide detailed recommendations and rationales. 

  * **Taskforce-endorsed reports** contain recommendations and agreed rationales, when the taskforce endorsed clinical committee reports (for example, Anaesthesia). 

  * **Taskforce findings** are provided for most specialties. These provide a summary of the recommendations agreed by the taskforce. 

  * **Taskforce recommendations** were provided for Primary Care and Telehealth. These list taskforce recommendations, as well as varying degrees of supporting information (including rationale).
