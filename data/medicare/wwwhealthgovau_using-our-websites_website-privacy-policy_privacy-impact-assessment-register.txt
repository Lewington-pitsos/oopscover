## What is the Privacy Impact Assessment Register

The Privacy Impact Assessment Register records details of PIAs conducted by us
since 1 July 2018.

## Why we have the register

The [Australian Government Agencies Privacy
Code](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-registers/privacy-codes-
register/australian-government-agencies-privacy-code) requires that all
agencies, including the Department of Health and Aged Care, must conduct a PIA
for all high privacy risk projects.

## Table of PIAs

The table below has details of PIAs completed since the Code came into effect
on 1 July 2018.
