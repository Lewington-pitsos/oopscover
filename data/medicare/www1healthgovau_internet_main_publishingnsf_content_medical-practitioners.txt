## Approval to supply PBS medicines

Approval may be granted to a medical practitioner to supply Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines in a particular area, typically remote or
isolated where the community does not have convenient and efficient access to
PBS medicines supplied by an approved community pharmacy in that area or
surrounding locality.  
The medical practitioner must:

  * be practising medicine in the area for which approval is being sought 
  * hold a current registration with the relevant state or territory medical board 
  * be willing to supply PBS medicines to any person in that area who presents a valid PBS prescription

## Submitting forms via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal

Each PBS Approved Suppliers form contains instructions on how it should be
returned. For further information on how to submit these forms via the PBS
Approved Suppliers Portal, refer to the guide: [How to upload PDF forms or
additional requested
information](/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/pharmaceutical-benefits-
scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms).  

## Permanent Services

To apply for approval to supply PBS medicines as a medical practitioner,
submit an [Application for a medical practitioner to supply pharmaceutical
benefits](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-
forms#medical) via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal.  
If a pharmacist becomes approved to supply PBS medicines to the community in
that area, or surrounding locality, the approval granted to the PBS medical
practitioner will be cancelled.  

## Temporary Services

Where there is no permanent medical practitioner approved to supply PBS in a
particular area, and a medical practitioner is employed to practise in that
area for a temporary period, that medical practitioner can apply for approval
to supply pharmaceutical benefits for the period they are employed to practise
in the area. An application can be made by submitting the [Application for a
medical practitioner to supply pharmaceutical benefits form](pharmaceutical-
benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms#medical) via the PBS
Approved Suppliers Portal. The approval will be cancelled on the date stated
on their application unless the practitioner requests an extension.  

## Locum Services

  * A locum for an existing medical practitioner approved to supply PBS, can act on behalf of the medical practitioner, using the approved medical practitioner’s approval number. 
  * The locum can use the approved medical practitioner's prescription forms, crossing out the existing prescriber's details and replacing them with their own, or use interim supply, unpersonalised prescription forms. 

In either case, the locum medical practitioner must write their prescriber
details on the prescription form.  
  
The approved medical practitioner must sign the PBS claim form, which includes
a declaration that items were supplied by them or on their behalf.  

  * The payment of PBS benefits will be made to the approved medical practitioner's nominated bank account. 
  * If the locum medical practitioner wishes the PBS benefits to be paid to their own bank account, they will need to apply for their own approval under section 92 of the _[National Health Act 1953](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1953A00095)_ using the [Application for a medical practitioner to supply pharmaceutical benefits form](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms#medical) submitted via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal. 

## Bank account details

Please complete and submit the [Notification of bank account details for an
approved medical practitioner form](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-
supplier-guides-and-forms#medical) via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal.
