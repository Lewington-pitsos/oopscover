# Shared Debt Recovery Scheme

If we detect incorrect Medicare payments during a compliance audit, the Shared
Debt Recovery Scheme allows us to split a debt between the practitioner and
the person who manages their billing and claiming.

## **About the scheme**

Health practitioners often engage people to manage their billing and claiming,
including under the:

  * [Medicare Benefits Schedule](http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/Home) (MBS)
  * [Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme](https://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) (PBS)
  * [Child Dental Benefits Schedule](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/child-dental-benefits-schedule) (CDBS)
  * [Practitioner Incentives Program](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/services/medicare/practice-incentives-program) (PIP).

If we detect incorrect Medicare payments during a compliance audit, the Shared
Debt Recovery Scheme enables us to split any debt between the:

  * health practitioner (primary debtor)
  * the employer of the person managing the billing (secondary debtor).

## **Why the scheme is important**

The scheme encourages health practitioners and their employers to work
together to:

  * minimise incorrect billing
  * respond to Medicare audits
  * promptly repay debts arising from incorrect Medicare billing.

## **How the process works**

Practitioners can request to split a debt with their employer before the
decision is made.

We will notify the employer that they are a potential secondary debtor.

We may request documents from both parties:

  * about the debt
  * about the contractual arrangement
  * supporting whether or not to share the debt.

We write to both parties with:

  * the total debt amount
  * how the debt is being split
  * how we determined the split
  * any documents provided about the debt.

Each party can make a submission on whether the debt should be shared, and how
it should be split.

We consider the submissions before making a shared debt determination.

## **When the scheme applies**

We can only make a shared debt determination when:

  * there is a debt for us to recover
  * there is an employment or other contractual arrangement between the primary and secondary debtor
  * the secondary debtor could have controlled or influenced the false or misleading statement, or made a financial benefit from it
  * other factors make it fair and reasonable for a shared debt determination.

## **When the scheme does not apply**

The scheme does not apply to:

  * adjustments that occur routinely as part of health practice, where a practitioner alerts us to an error to correct the claims record
  * a voluntary acknowledgement by a practitioner of incorrect payments
  * debts arising from inappropriate practice following referral to the Professional Services Review
  * debts arising from one party having committed Medicare fraud without knowledge of the other.

## **How the debt is shared**

By default:

  * the health practitioner is responsible for 65% of the debt
  * the employer or person in a contractual arrangement such as a corporate (secondary debtor) is responsible for 35% of the debt.

We will consider a different split that is fair and reasonable, depending on:

  * any arrangements between the parties for apportioning the benefits paid (we look at the proportion of the benefits the health practitioner receives)
  * what influence or control the secondary debtor may have had over the billing.

## **Legislation**

The national [Health Insurance Act
1973](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2022C00174) governs the Shared
Debt Recovery Scheme. The [Health Insurance (Medicare Compliance Shared Debt)
Instrument 2019](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2019L00503) sets the
recoverable amounts.
