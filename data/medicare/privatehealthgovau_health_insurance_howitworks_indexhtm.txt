## Private Health Insurance Basics

Private health insurance policies cover you when you go to hospital or when
you receive non-hospital medical services that are not covered by Medicare.
You can choose from different levels of cover - the higher hospital policies
include a broader range of services, and the higher general treatment (extras)
policies cover a broader range of services and in some cases higher benefits.

There are generally three types of [private health
insurance](/health_insurance/what_is_covered/privatehealth.htm "What is
covered by private health insurance?") \- hospitalÂ policiesÂ cover you when
you go to hospital, while general treatment policies (sometimes known as
ancillary or extras)Â cover you for ancillary treatment (e.g. dental,
physiotherapy), and ambulance policies cover you for ambulance transport.Â

Most [health insurers](/health_insurance/howitworks/registeredinsurers.htm
"health insurers") offer combined policies that provide aÂ packagedÂ cover for
both hospital and general treatment services, or you can buy separate hospital
and general treatmentÂ policies to 'mix and match'.

### What should I consider when purchasing health insurance?

  *  **Waiting periods:Â** If you are purchasing coverÂ for the first time orÂ upgrading your plan,Â you need to serve aÂ [waiting period](/health_insurance/howitworks/waiting_periods.htm "Waiting periods")Â before you can claim your benefits. During the waiting period, you do not receive any benefits for certain treatments orÂ you receive lower benefits for a period of time.
  *  **What isn't covered on my policy:Â** You should take note of what is and isn't covered on your policy - not all policies are comprehensive. Depending on your level of cover, you may not be fully covered against all costs associated with your treatment and will have to pay someÂ [out-of-pocket expenses](/health_insurance/howitworks/out_of_pocket.htm "Out of pocket expenses \(gap cover\)").
  *  **Your healthcare needs:Â** You should review your coverÂ from time to time to ensure it still meets your needs.Â IfÂ the premiumÂ has become a concern for you, there are a number of ways you may be able to [manage your policy](/health_insurance/howitworks/managing_your_policy.htm "Managing your policy")Â and lower costs. If you already have private health insurance,Â you can also considerÂ moving to a different insurer.
  *  **Comparing health insurance policies** : every policy available for sale in Australia is summarised on this website in the form of a [Private Health Information Statement](/health_insurance/howitworks/phis_guide.htm "Private Health Information Statements")Â (PHIS) to make it easier to compare policies. For private hospital cover, standard [Clinical categories](/health_insurance/howitworks/clinical_categories.htm "Clinical categories") specify what is and is not covered on each policy.
