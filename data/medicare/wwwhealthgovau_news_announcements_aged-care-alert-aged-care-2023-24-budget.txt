The Australian Government has committed to restore dignity to aged care,
ensuring older people are treated with the respect they deserve.

The [Government’s 2023-24 Budget](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/aged-
care-reforms/what-were-doing) responds to recommendations of the Royal
Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, supporting key initiatives to:

  * Fund the [Fair Work Commission interim decision](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/aged-care-workforce/what-were-doing/better-and-fairer-wages?language=en) for a 15% pay increase, the largest ever wage increase for aged care workers, recognising the complex work they do.
  * Improve [provider regulation through a new regulatory model](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/aged-care-reforms/what-were-doing/measuring-success), to be reflected in a new Aged Care Act, and enhancing measurement of quality standards.
  * [Establish a new Aged Care Taskforce](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/aged-care-reforms/what-were-doing/sustainable-care#establishing-a-new-aged-care-taskforce) to review aged care funding arrangements and develop options to make the system fair and equitable for all Australians.
  * Develop the [final design of the Support at Home program](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/aged-care-reforms/what-were-doing/trusted-safe-and-high-quality-care#preparing-for-a-new-inhome-aged-care-program), postponed to commence on 1 July 2025, allowing for further refinement of the program’s design.
  * Put [older people at the centre of residential aged care](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/aged-care-reforms/what-were-doing/older-people-at-the-centre), assigning care places to people.
  * Introduce [new initiatives for GPs to provide care to residents](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/aged-care-reforms/what-were-doing/older-people-at-the-centre#new-incentive-for-gps-to-improve-primary-care) through My Medicare.
  * Ensure [long term sustainability for the aged care system](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/aged-care-reforms/what-were-doing/sustainable-care), providers will be monitored for financial risk and viability supported through targeted programs.
  * Improve access to [high quality aged care for First Nations elders](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/aged-care-reforms/what-were-doing/equitable-access) and boost provider support and worker training to build care capacity.
