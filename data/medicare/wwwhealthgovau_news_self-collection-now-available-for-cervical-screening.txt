New changes to the National Cervical Screening Program mean that all eligible
screeners – women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 74 – will be able to
choose to have a Cervical Screening Test either by:

  * taking your own sample from your vagina, using a simple swab (self-collection)
  * having a healthcare provider collect your sample from the cervix using a speculum.

Both options are:

  * free under Medicare – so if your healthcare provider bulk bills for consultations, the whole thing is free
  * accessed through a healthcare provider
  * accurate and safe ways to collect a sample for a Cervical Screening Test.

When you opt to collect your own vaginal sample, you will be provided with a
swab by your healthcare provider and instructions on how to do the test. The
sample can be taken in a private space (behind a curtain or in the bathroom).

Self-collection is available any time a HPV test is needed. This includes for
follow-up HPV testing after an intermediate risk result and cervical screening
during pregnancy.
