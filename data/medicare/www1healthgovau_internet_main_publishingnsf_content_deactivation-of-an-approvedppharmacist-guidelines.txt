## Meaning of the term “deactivate”

The term “deactivate” is not an expression used or defined in the _National
Health Act 1953_ (the Act). It is, instead, an administrative concept,
intended to describe situations which arise when the Secretary of Health (or
his/her delegate) decides not to cancel an approval under subsection 98(3),
notwithstanding that the statutory precondition to such a decision (namely,
that the approved pharmacist has ceased to carry on business as a pharmacist
at the premises in respect of which the pharmacist is approved) has been
satisfied.  
  
The delegate is not bound by these guidelines and is legally obliged to take
into consideration all relevant circumstances in reaching a decision in
individual cases. In the event of any conflict between these guidelines and
the legislation, the legislation prevails.  
A decision associated with a request to deactivate an approval, which will
result in the cessation of supply of pharmaceutical benefits at particular
premises, can only be made by a delegate of the Secretary, under section 98 of
the Act.  

## Applications for deactivation

An approved pharmacist who needs to close their pharmacy temporarily must
first request deactivation, in writing, before ceasing supply of
pharmaceutical benefits. Closure of a pharmacy without first seeking
deactivation may result in the cancellation of the pharmacist’s approval to
supply pharmaceutical benefits at those premises. The pharmacist is required
to include in the request the reasons for the closure and, if required,
supporting documents.  

## Important considerations

In considering a request for deactivation, the need for the community to have
access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits is important when deciding
whether or not to grant deactivation, and is also a relevant factor in
determining the length of time to grant deactivation.  
  
It is important to note that the continuing commercial viability of a pharmacy
is not generally a relevant consideration when deciding whether to grant
deactivation.  

## Requests for deactivation

The delegate will consider a request to deactivate an approval for a short and
specific period of time in the following circumstances:  
**(1) There is no proposed change in the location of the pharmacy or the
approved pharmacist**  
Where:

  * the approved pharmacist needs to close the pharmacy for compelling and demonstrated personal reasons (e.g. illness), and the service of a locum pharmacist could not be obtained to operate the pharmacy; or

  * the approved pharmacist is unable to open the pharmacy for reasons which are beyond the control of the approved pharmacist, such us urgent repairs or unexpected damage.

**(2) There is a proposed change in the approved pharmacist and no proposed
change in the location of the pharmacy**  
Where:

  * the approved pharmacist has entered into a contract for sale, transfer or disposal of the pharmacy at its current location; and 
  * the approved pharmacist is unable, for reasons beyond their control, to carry on business as a pharmacist at the pharmacy until the transfer of ownership occurs.

**(3) There is a proposed change in the location of the pharmacy, irrespective
of whether there is also a proposed change in the approved pharmacist**  
Where:

  * the approved pharmacist wishes to relocate the pharmacy to other premises and is intending to make an application to the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority (the Authority) to relocate and the approved pharmacist cannot, for reasons which are beyond their control, continue to carry on business as a pharmacist at the premises in respect of which the pharmacist is approved; or

  * the approved pharmacist wishes to relocate the pharmacy to other premises and an application has been made to the Authority to relocate and the approved pharmacist cannot, for reasons which are beyond their control, continue to carry on business as a pharmacist at the premises in respect of which the pharmacist is approved; or 
  * the Authority has made a recommendation to the Secretary’s delegate to approve an application to relocate the pharmacy and the existing approved pharmacist cannot, for reasons which are beyond their control, continue to carry on business as a pharmacist at the premises in respect of which the pharmacist is approved, or to carry on business as a pharmacist at the proposed premises. 

Note - a request to deactivate where the premises have been vacated and the
approved pharmacist is looking for alternative premises, may not be a
sufficient reason to grant deactivation.  

## Relationship to the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority process

The Australian Community Pharmacy Authority can only consider recommending
approval of an application to relocate a pharmacy that is closed, where the
approval has been deactivated.  

## Making a request to deactivate

A request to deactivate must be made in writing to email
[pbsapprovedsuppliers@health.gov.au](mailto:pbsapprovedsupplier@health.gov.au)
clearly articulating the reasons for seeking deactivation. Some examples
include:

  * evidence supporting the steps to resolve leasing or legal disputes and potential alternatives for the pharmacist; 
  * written advice from the leasing management about renovations to the premises and the need for the pharmacy to vacate for a specific period; 
  * written confirmation of an inability to operate the pharmacy due to illness; 
  * written evidence that the services of a locum pharmacist could not be obtained to continue the pharmacy business.

The application must also include the period of time for which the applicant
is seeking deactivation.  
  
The Department may, at any time:

  * ask for additional information from the approved pharmacist during the deactivation period; 
  * vary the deactivation period; 
  * notify the approved pharmacist if the Delegate intends cancelling the approval. 

## Extending the deactivation period

The Delegate will only consider extending the period of deactivation beyond
the original period in exceptional circumstances and with supporting
documentation.  

## Change of circumstances

The Delegate uses the reasons outlined in the request when deciding whether or
not to grant deactivation and the length of time of the deactivation.  
  
The approved pharmacist must notify the Department in writing if circumstances
change at any stage during the deactivation period, and before the end of the
deactivation period.  
  
If the Delegate becomes aware of any significant change in the approved
pharmacist’s circumstances, they may ask the approved pharmacist to provide
reasons in writing as to why the approval should not be cancelled.
