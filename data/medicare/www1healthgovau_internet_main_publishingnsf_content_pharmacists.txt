## Change pharmacy ownership (not involving relocation)

New owners must be approved to supply PBS medicines. To apply for approval to
change ownership of a pharmacy, the incoming owner(s) must:

  * access the [PBS Approved Suppliers Porta](https://pbsapprovedsuppliers.health.gov.au/)l to lodge an application (please note, [Terms of Use](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-terms-of-use-for-pharmacy-approvals-portal) must be agreed to access the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal); and 
  * before the PBS approval can be granted, provide evidence that the requirements of the relevant state or territory regulatory authority have been met.

If approved, the Department of Health and Aged Care will issue a new pharmacy
approval number and cancel the approval number of the previous owner(s). The
new owner(s) will need to register for online claiming of PBS medicines, and
provide Notification of Australian Business Number. [Read more about
registering for online claiming for
PBS](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/organisations/health-
professionals/enablers/register-online-claiming-pbs/32456).  
  

**IMPORTANT**

If you are an applicant preparing and submitting an application on behalf of
other applicant(s), or you are another person appointed by the applicant(s) to
prepare and submit an application on their behalf, please download the
[Appointment of a representative form](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-
approved-supplier-guides-and-forms#pharmacists). When completed, this form
must be attached to the application at the 'Declarations' section of the [PBS
Approved Suppliers Portal](https://pbsapprovedsuppliers.health.gov.au/).

When preparing a change of ownership application (with or without relocation),
please download the [Current Owner(s) Declaration Form](pharmaceutical-
benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms#pharmacists). When
completed, this form must be attached to the application at the 'Declarations'
section of the [PBS Approved Suppliers
Portal](https://pbsapprovedsuppliers.health.gov.au/).

## How long does the change of ownership application process take?

Processing of an application for a change of ownership (not involving
relocation) currently takes up to 30 business days; therefore, applications
are to be submitted at least 30 days prior to the anticipated
opening/settlement date.  
  
Following lodgement and payment of the fee, the application will be checked
against the [Valid Application Checklist](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-
approved-supplier-guides-and-forms#guides). Applications will be checked in
order of receipt and within 20 business days of lodgement. During this time,
the application contact will be advised as follows:

  * if the application is invalid – the application will be returned for resubmission via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal (the process, including the 20 business days, will restart from the date the application is resubmitted); or 
  * if the application is valid – an administration number will be issued.

Once the administration number has been issued, it will be displayed on the
PBS Approved Suppliers Portal and the application contact will be notified via
email and advised of the next steps.  
  
The Delegate can grant approval only during business hours and on a business
day in the Australian Capital Territory.  
  
On the day of settlement, prior to 4:00 pm Canberra time, the application
contact must email the Department to provide any outstanding documents and
confirm that the pharmacy has legally transferred to the applicant
pharmacist(s) and the pharmacy is open and able to supply PBS medicines.  
  
Once confirmed, the new owner(s) will be approved to supply PBS medicines.  
(Note that PBS online cannot be accessed without a PRODA account. See the
section below about claiming for PBS medicines.)  
  
To view the end-to-end process for a change of ownership application, see the
[Change of Ownership application process map](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-
approved-supplier-guides-and-forms#supporting).

The Department of Health and Aged Care must be notified as soon as possible if
an owner of an approved pharmacy is bankrupt or if an external administrator
has been appointed in relation to the pharmacy, on or after 5 December 2019.  
  
The appointed trustee in bankruptcy (or external administrator) may apply for
permission under [section
91B](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2019A00077) of the _[National
Health Act 1953](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1953A00095)_ to supply
pharmaceutical benefits at the pharmacy for a temporary period. This is until

  * submit an [Application for permission to supply pharmaceutical benefits following bankruptcy or external administration form](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms#pharmacists) via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal; and 
  * attach evidence of the appointment.

A separate application form is required for each premises where the trustee
(or external administrator) seeks to supply pharmaceutical benefits.  
  
Permission can only be granted where the pharmacy can continue (or resume)
operating to ensure the community has access to pharmaceutical benefits.  
  
Where an approved pharmacist who is a member of a partnership becomes
bankrupt, unless all partners are bankrupt, an application should not be made
by the trustee in bankruptcy.  
  
The appointed trustee in bankruptcy (or external administrator) is also
required to notify the relevant state or territory regulatory authority of the
appointment.  

## Death of approved pharmacist

The Department of Health and Aged Care must be notified as soon as possible if
an approved pharmacist dies. The executor of the estate can be granted
permission, under [section
91](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nha1953147/s91.html)
of the _[National Health Act
1953](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1953A00095)_ , to supply
pharmaceutical benefits at the pharmacy.  
  
The deceased’s pharmacy may only be operated by:

  * a legal personal representative; 
  * an executor; or 
  * an administrator whose duty it is to settle the affairs of the deceased.

A legal personal representative may apply to operate the pharmacy for a
temporary period. This is until the granting of probate or letters of
administration. If there are multiple executors in the will, any can apply
jointly.  
  
The representative(s) will need to:

  * submit an [Application for permission to carry on business as a pharmacist by the legal personal representative of a deceased approved pharmacy form](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-forms#pharmacists) via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal;

certified copy of a document that includes the applicant’s photograph and
signature, such as a:

  * driver’s licence; 
  * passport; or 
  * photo ID card.

A certified copy of a document that includes the applicant’s signature, and a
statutory declaration is also acceptable. The statutory declaration must be
signed by the applicant and indicate the applicant is the person named in the
document.  
  
The applicant must also submit an [Authority to authorise pharmacist(s) to
sign claim forms on behalf of section 91/91B permission holder
form](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-
forms#pharmacists) via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal.  
Following a grant of probate or letters of administration, the beneficiary of
the pharmacy will need to submit an [Application to carry on business as a
pharmacist by a beneficiary of a deceased approved pharmacist
form](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-guides-and-
forms#pharmacists) via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal. Approval can only be
granted to the beneficiary who is himself/herself a registered pharmacist.  
One of the following is also required:

  * a certified copy of the deceased approved pharmacist's will; 
  * a letter of probate; or 
  * a statutory declaration signed by the applicant.

Section 91 of the Act does not apply if the deceased pharmacist had a
partnership agreement or contract in place that deals with the pharmacy
business.  
  
The partners must provide:

  * a certified copy of the deceased approved pharmacist death certificate; and 
  * a copy of the partnership agreement.

The partner must also submit the [Notification of bank account details for an
approved pharmacy form](pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme-approved-supplier-
guides-and-forms#pharmacists) via the PBS Approved Suppliers Portal.  
  
Some additional forms may be required depending on the circumstances.
