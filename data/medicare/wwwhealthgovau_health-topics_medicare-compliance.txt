  * [About Medicare compliance](/topics/medicare/compliance/about "About Medicare compliance")  
Our compliance program helps to ensure all Medicare claims are correct and
legitimate. This helps keep our healthcare system sustainable and ensures we
remain accountable to Australian taxpayers for payments we make under
Medicare.

  * [When Medicare compliance applies](/topics/medicare/compliance/when-it-applies "When Medicare compliance applies")  
Legislative requirements apply to health practitioners who bill, claim,
dispense and prescribe under the MBS, CDBS and PBS, and to organisations
receiving PIP payments.

  * [How to comply with Medicare obligations](/topics/medicare/compliance/how-to-comply "How to comply with Medicare obligations")  
As a health practitioner, it is your responsibility to comply with Medicare
obligations. It’s important to do the relevant training and understand the
requirements and laws that apply. We provide lots of education and support to
help you meet your obligations.

  * [Our Medicare compliance activities](/topics/medicare/compliance/our-activities "Our Medicare compliance activities")  
We are accountable for payments made under Medicare programs. We review and
audit health practitioners’ claims to make sure they are legitimate. We
support health practitioners to comply with Medicare requirements, with a
focus on prevention and early intervention.

  * [Voluntary acknowledgement of incorrect payments](/topics/medicare/compliance/voluntary-acknowledgement-of-incorrect-payments "Voluntary acknowledgement of incorrect payments")  
If you think you've incorrectly claimed a Medicare or practice incentive
payment, you must let us know as soon as you can. You can do this by
submitting a voluntary acknowledgement of incorrect payments form.

  * [Non-compliance debts and penalties](/topics/medicare/compliance/debts-and-penalties "Non-compliance debts and penalties")  
You must repay any incorrect payments made to you under Medicare. You might
also have to pay additional penalties. How you work with us can decrease or
increase any penalty amount.

  * [Reporting incorrect billing, claiming, or suspected fraud](/topics/medicare/compliance/reporting-incorrect-billing-claiming-or-suspected-fraud "Reporting incorrect billing, claiming, or suspected fraud")  
We protect the integrity of health programs by making sure that correct
payments are made for the right services. If you think a doctor or pharmacist
has charged you, or claimed for, a service or product you didn’t receive, let
us know here.
