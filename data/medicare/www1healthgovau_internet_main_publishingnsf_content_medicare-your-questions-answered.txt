_Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre project_

**_Comprehensive Cancer Centres_**  
Quality cancer services that are accessible to all Australians, including
those living in rural and regional areas, are a priority.

Integrated Cancer Centres is a major initiative that includes building two
state-of-the-art integrated cancer centres – The Chris O’Brien Lifehouse at
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney and the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer
Centre (VCCC) in Melbourne.

The VCCC project is delivering a new $1 billion facility purpose built for
cancer research, treatment and care in Melbourne. It is jointly funded by the
Victorian and Australian Governments and will include the Peter McCallum
Cancer Centre. Construction commenced in 2011 and service delivery will
commence in 2016.

major cities.

![Classic double helix](/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/medicare-your-
questions-answered/$file/doubleheilix.png)  
_Classic double helix_

Medicare aims to ensure that all Australians have access to free or low-cost
medical, optometry, midwifery and hospital care and, in special circumstances,
allied health services.  
In 2012-13, Medicare rebates were provided for 343.6 million services in
Australia, an average of 14.8 services per person.  
New medical technologies and procedures are not necessarily more effective and
safer than existing health services.  
The comparative safety, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of new,
amended and reviewed medical services are assessed by the Medical Services
Advisory Committee (MSAC).  
MSAC provides advice to the Minister for Health for decision.  
The Department of Health is required to consider the financial impact, submit
the proposed changes for consideration by government, and draft and implement
legislative change before an item is included or amended on the Medicare
Benefits Schedule (MBS).

  * [How to List on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS](http://www.msac.gov.au/internet/msac/publishing.nsf/Content/msac-application-process-lp-1))
  * [Current MSAC Assessments](http://www.msac.gov.au/internet/msac/publishing.nsf/Content/current-assessments-1) __

  10. **What can I do if the service my specialist has recommended is not funded under Medicare?**

Talk to your specialist to discuss treatment options and fees, including co-
payments (the part of the bill that you pay).
