## **Extras cover**

General treatment cover, often referred to as extras cover, helps with the
cost of health services that Medicare does **not** cover. These services can
be:

  * physiotherapy
  * chiropractic treatment
  * home nursing
  * dental treatment
  * orthodontics
  * speech therapy
  * glasses and contact lenses.

### **Levels of cover**

Private health insurance policies offer different levels of extras cover. Some
may cover many services while some cover only a few.

### **Limited cover for costs**

Extras cover only covers **some** of the cost of most services. Many policies
only allow you to claim:

  * a certain percent of costs for each service – for example, cover for 50% of the cost for each dental treatment, or
  * a certain amount for the same service each year – for example, cover for up to $500 each year for dental treatments

Make sure you understand what’s covered when you [choose private health
insurance](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/private-health-
insurance/about-private-health-insurance/choosing-private-health-insurance).

## **Ambulance cover**

Medicare doesn’t cover the cost of emergency ambulance transport or other
ambulance services.

Depending on where you live you might get a discount for ambulance services or
not need cover at all.

You can buy private ambulance cover from a private health insurer or, where
available, from a state or territory ambulance authority.
