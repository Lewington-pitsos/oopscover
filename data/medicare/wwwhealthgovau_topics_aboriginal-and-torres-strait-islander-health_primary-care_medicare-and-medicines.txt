Strait Islander people

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can use the Indigenous Access
Program to find out about Medicare and medication entitlements. Other
arrangements allow Indigenous health services to access Medicare billing for
their patients.

## Medicare arrangements

### For individuals

The [Indigenous Access
Program](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/indigenous-
access-program) provides access to Medicare services for Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander people. The program provides:

  * an [Indigenous access phone line](/contacts/services-australia-indigenous-access-line "Services Australia Indigenous Access Line") with culturally trained staff who can match people with the right Medicare services
  * Medicare liaison officers who work with communities and health services around Australia
  * a free [annual health check](/topics/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-health/primary-care/annual-health-checks "Annual health checks for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people") (also called a 715 check) every 9 to 12 months
  * Closing the Gap pharmaceutical benefits.

### For health services

The Minister for Health issued a special direction allowing Aboriginal
Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs) to access Medicare billing. See
our list of ACCHSs with 19(2) and 19(5) directions.

Usually, health services cannot access Medicare benefits when the Australian
Government provides other funding for the services. As ACCHSs receive
Government funding through the [Indigenous Australians' Health
Programme](/our-work/indigenous-australians-health-programme "Indigenous
Australians' Health Programme ") (IAHP), they would not normally be eligible
to bill Medicare for their services. The Minister allowed access to Medicare
billing because:

  * all Australians have a right to access Medicare
  * the cost of providing comprehensive primary health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities is substantially higher than for non-Indigenous Australians.

See our list of [MBS items for Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services
and other primary health care providers](/resources/publications/frequently-
claimed-mbs-items-for-aboriginal-community-controlled-health-services-and-
other-primary-health-care-providers "Frequently claimed MBS items for
Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services and other primary health care
providers").

Services Australia provides a [guide to Medicare for Indigenous health
services](http://medicareaust.com/PROGRAMS/IHSP02/index.html).

Health Service near you.

## Medicare liaison officers

Medicare liaison officers undertake cultural training. They work with
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and health services to:

  * provide information about MBS items available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients
  * provide training to health service staff about Indigenous health care plans
  * increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's enrolments in Medicare
  * ensure correct claiming of Medicare benefits
  * provide support and advice about new Medicare initiatives
  * represent and promote Medicare programs and services at local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander forums and events.

Services Australia have more [information about Medicare liaison
officers](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/indigenous-
access-program/what-it/medicare-liaison-officers).

## Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme arrangements

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) includes [items listed to treat
conditions common in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
communities](https://www.pbs.gov.au/info/publication/factsheets/shared/pbs-
listings-for-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-people). These items are
specifically for patients who identify as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait
Islander.

The PBS lists these items to:

  * address the greater burden of disease experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples
  * provide greater choice in treatment options, particularly for conditions seen almost exclusively in this population.

### PBS Closing the Gap co-payment

The [Closing the Gap PBS Co-payment
Program](https://www.pbs.gov.au/info/publication/factsheets/closing-the-gap-
pbs-co-payment-measure) aims to reduce the cost of PBS medicines for
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with a chronic disease (or at
risk of a chronic disease). Registered patients receive PBS medicines for free
(with a Health Care Card) or at a lower price.

Services Australia has more information:

  * [for health professionals](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/services/medicare/closing-gap-pbs-co-payment-measure), including an [education guide](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/organisations/health-professionals/topics/education-guide-closing-gap-pbs-co-payment-measure-supporting-indigenous-health/31811)
  * [for patients](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/indigenous-access-program/how-access-better-health-services/close-gap-pbs-prescriptions).
