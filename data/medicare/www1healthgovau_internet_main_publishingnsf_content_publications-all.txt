### [Position statement on interferon-γ release assays for the detection of
latent tuberculosis infection](/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cdi4104-c
"Position statement on interferon-γ release assays for the detection of latent
tuberculosis infection")

Interferon- _y_ release assays (IGRAs), such as the Quantiferon (QIFN) TB-Gold
Plus assay (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the _T-SPOT.TB_ test (Oxford
Immunotec Limited, Abingdon, United Kingdom), are marketed as a substitute for
the tuberculin skin test (TST) for the detection of latent tuberculosis
infection (LTBI). The relative merits of IGRAs and TST have been hotly debated
over the last decade. The specificity of IGRAs has been optimised by using
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ -specific antigens. However, IGRAs are functional
_in vitro_ T-cell-based assays that may lack reproducibility due to specimen
collection, transport, processing and kit manufacturing issues.

Longitudinal studies comparing the ability of IGRAs and TST to predict the
future development of active tuberculosis disease (TB) are the ultimate
arbiters on the respective utility of these assays. Three meta-analyses
addressing this comparison have now been published and clinical experience
with IGRAs is accumulating. The systematic reviews show that IGRAs and TST
have similar (but poor) ability to identify patients with LTBI at risk of
developing active TB disease. The improved specificity of IGRAs however may
reduce the number of patients requiring preventative therapy.

Based on these meta-analyses, The National Tuberculosis Advisory Committee
(NTAC) now recommends either TST or an IGRA for the investigation of LTBI in
most circumstances. Both tests may be used in patients where the risk of
progression to active TB disease is high and the disease sequelae potentially
severe (eg. LTBI testing in immunocompromised patients or those commencing
anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF) therapy). Neither test should be used in
the investigation of active TB disease (though TST and/or IGRA may be used as
supplementary tests in paediatric cases). The choice of test for serial
testing in healthcare workers (HCWs) remains controversial. A preference
remains for TST in this circumstance because IGRAs have been bedevilled by
higher rates of reversions and conversions when used for serial testing. These
recommendations supersede all previous NTAC IGRA statements.

There were 22 people sick (attack rate 55%); 7 had laboratory confirmed _S_.
Muenchen infection; 2 required medical evacuation and admission to the
intensive care unit (ICU). We conducted a descriptive case series to
investigate the outbreak. All cases ate meat from a single green turtle (
_Chelonia mydas_ ). The animal’s pre-death stress, improper butchering,
insufficient cooking and the unsatisfactory storage of meat all likely
contributed to the outbreak. Turtle meat should be prepared safely, cooked
thoroughly and stored appropriately to avoid _Salmonella_ infection.

### [National position statement for the management of latent tuberculosis
infection](/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cdi4103-d "National position
statement for the management of latent tuberculosis infection")

The primary role of any tuberculosis (TB) control program is to ensure the
prompt identification and effective treatment of active disease. The host
immune system often succeeds in containing the initial (or primary) infection
with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but may fail to eliminate the pathogen.
The persistence of viable organisms explains the potential for the development
of active disease years or even decades after infection. This is known as
latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) although, rather than a distinct entity,
this probably represents part of a dynamic spectrum. Individuals with LTBI are
asymptomatic and it is therefore clinically undetectable. The World Health
Organization (WHO) estimates that one-third of the global population has been
infected with Mtb, with highest prevalence of LTBI in countries/regions with
the highest prevalence of active disease. In 2013, 88% of 1322 notifications
in Australia were in the overseas-born population (incidence 19.5 per 100,000
v. 1.0 per 100,000), with this proportion rising over the course of the last
decade. Combined with epidemiological evidence of low local transmission, this
strongly implies that the vast majority resulted from reactivation of latent
infection acquired prior to immigration. Contrasting trends in TB incidence in
other developed countries probably reflect differences in policy regarding
LTBI. Conclusion: The diagnosis and treatment of LTBI represents an important
opportunity for intervention by jurisdictional TB control programs.

### [National Tuberculosis Advisory Committee Guideline: Management of
Tuberculosis Risk in Healthcare Workers in
Australia](/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cdi4103-c "National
Tuberculosis Advisory Committee Guideline: Management of Tuberculosis Risk in
Healthcare Workers in Australia")

Tuberculosis (TB) is uncommon in Australia and not commonly managed by most
healthcare workers (HCWs). However, even in a low incidence setting,
occasional exposure of HCWs is inevitable and transmission of TB to HCWs
leading to disease does occur. In addition, HCWs may have been recruited to
Australia from countries with high TB incidence. These HCWs are more likely to
be infected with TB before arrival and subsequently develop active disease
while working in health settings in Australia. In 2001, there were 20 TB
notifications in HCWs in Australia, of which 10 were born overseas, whereas in
2013, 70 of 77 notified cases (91%) were people born overseas.1, 2 Managing
the risk of TB in HCWs is multifaceted. A combination of staff education,
awareness, early diagnosis, appropriate use of personal protective equipment
(PPE), environmental controls and screening procedures is required to minimise
the risk of transmission to HCWs and from HCWs to patients. Prevention of
nosocomial transmission from HCWs is particularly important in patients that
are more vulnerable, for example children and the immunocompromised. This
document aims to describe the components that are considered essential for all
healthcare facilities in Australia to minimise this risk. It is not intended
to be operational, and reference should be made to specific state and
territory TB Control Program policies for this detail. Each facility should
develop its own policy for the management of TB risk in HCWs according to this
jurisdictional policy and the facility specific factors that determine risk,
but it should include at least the following components.

In 2014, the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System received 1,339
tuberculosis (TB) notifications, representing a rate of 5.7 per 100,000
population. Australia has achieved and maintained good tuber¬culosis (TB)
control since the mid-1980s, sustaining a low annual TB incidence rate of
approximately 5 to 6 cases per 100,000 population. The number of multi-drug
resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases diagnosed in Australia is low by international
standards, with approximately 1-2% of notifications per year being classified
as MDR-TB. Australia’s overseas-born pop¬ulation continued to represent the
majority (86%) of TB notifications and Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander population continue to record TB rates around 6 times higher
than the Australian born non Indigenous population. Whilst Australia has
achieved excellent and sustained control of TB in Australia, sustained effort
is still required to reduce rates further and contribute to the achievement of
the World Health Organization’s goal to end the global TB epidemic by 2035.

doesn’t provide a bacterial culture for further characterisation or
antimicrobial susceptibility testing. It is recommended that laboratories
continue to perform culture of specimens in addition to culture independent

asked particularly to assess effects of that legislation on competition in the
regulatory areas of the ownership of pharmacies, the location of pharmacies
for the purposes of the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and the
registration of pharmacists.

Three strategies, singly or in combination for the primary prevention of
Neural Tube Defects, are now in use in several countries. These include:
fortification of foods with folate, promotion of periconceptional use of
folate supplements, and promotion of diets high in natural sources of folate.
Folate fortification is the preferred strategy in many countries because of
its potential to reach the largest proportion of women of child-bearing age
prior to conception, in doses thought to be effective. As yet, no systematic
evaluations of the outcomes of national folate fortification programs have
been published; these are early days.

Obesity](/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-food-
pdf-diabetes-cnt.htm "Type 2 Diabetes Costs in Australia - The Potential
Impact of Changes in Diet, Physical Activity and Levels of Obesity")

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterised by insulin insufficiency
or resistance to its action, resulting in poor glycaemic control. The recent
Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab) estimated that
close to one million (7.5%) Australian adults have diabetes mellitus (Dunstan
et al 2001). Type 2 diabetes is the most common form comprising 85 to 90% of
those with diabetes mellitus. The most recent cost estimates available suggest
approximately $216.7 million in health system costs were attributable to Type
2 diabetes in 1993-94 (Mathers & Penm 1998). In a study of the burden of
disease in Australia, diabetes mellitus was estimated to account for 5% of the
total burden of disease and was the seventh leading cause of Australian deaths
(Mathers, Vos & Stevenson 1999). In addition, complications of diabetes such
as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney problems, and lower limb
amputations, contribute significantly to the overall morbidity and mortality
in Australia.

This report provides guidelines for comparing results from the 1983 National
Dietary Survey, the 1985 National Dietary Survey of School children and the
1995 National Nutrition Survey. The principle finding of the study is that it
is inappropriate to directly compare published results from the 1983 and 1985
surveys with those from the 1995 survey to assess trends in the food and
nutrient intake of adults and children. Allowances are needed to account for
differences in sample design, collection and processing practices, the food
composition databases and changes in the demographic composition of the
Australian population between these surveys. The bridging study findings
enable the results from these three surveys to be used in dietary monitoring
in Australia.
