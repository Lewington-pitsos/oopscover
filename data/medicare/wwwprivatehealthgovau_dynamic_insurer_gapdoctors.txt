## Gap cover doctors

A 'medical gap' is any [out-of-pocket
expense](/health_insurance/howitworks/out_of_pocket.htm "Out of pocket
expenses \(gap cover\)") incurred by a patient for their medical treatment
during their stay in hospital, reflecting the difference between the total fee
charged by the doctor and any Medicare rebate plus health insurer benefit.
Unless your health insurer has a gap cover arrangement in place with your
doctor which will cover all of your doctor's charge, you will have to
contribute towards the doctor's bill out of your own pocket.

It is important that you contact your health insurer before you receive
hospital treatment to check whether your doctor is participating in the
insurer's gap cover arrangements. You should also ask your doctor(s) how much
you will have to pay over and above your insurance cover. It is up to the
doctor to decide on a case-by-case basis whether he or she wishes to use an
insurer's gap cover arrangement.

Some insurers have specific information on their site, or you may have to
contact them to obtain details of their gap cover arrangements.
